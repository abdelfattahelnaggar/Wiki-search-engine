Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research

The Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) project is a project that is used for the finding and tracking of near-Earth asteroids. The project is done together by the United States Air Force, NASA, and MIT's Lincoln Laboratory. LINEAR has found most of the asteroids since 1998. LINEAR has found 226,193 new objects since it started. Out of those, 2,019 were near-Earth asteroids and 236 were comets. LINEAR uses robotic telescopes to help them find asteroids. LINEAR is credited with the finding of 67,208 asteroids as of June 13, 2006. LINEAR has also found these comets: 11P/Tempel-Swift-LINEAR, 146P/Shoemaker-LINEAR, 148P/Anderson-LINEAR, 156P/Russell-LINEAR, 158P/Kowal-LINEAR, 160P/LINEAR (LINEAR 43), 165P/LINEAR (LINEAR 10), and 176P/LINEAR.

Hurricane Nate (2005)

Hurricane Nate was an Atlantic hurricane in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. It came close to Bermuda, but did not land there. Nate was the 14th named storm and 7th hurricane of the 2005 season. It started southwest of Bermuda on September 5. It then moved northeast very slowly. It passed south of Bermuda and moved into colder waters. Then, it began to weaken. Nate later became part of a larger weather system.

The storm caused no damage because it stayed at sea. However, one person was killed from rip currents that were caused by the storm. Nate caused light rainfall and gusty winds on Bermuda. Canadian Navy ships that were carrying supplies to help people after Hurricane Katrina were slowed down because of Nate.

Chromalveolate

Chromalveolata is a eukaryote supergroup first proposed by Thomas Cavalier-Smith as a refinement of his kingdom Chromista, which was first proposed in 1981.

The origin of the Chromalveolata was thought to be a secondary endosymbiosis between a bikont (cell with two flagella) and a red alga. This union led to plastids containing chlorophyll c. In Cavalier-Smith's classification, the Chromalveolata was one of the six major groups within the eukaryotes.

The classification has been challenged.

Hurricane Irene (2005)

Hurricane Irene was an Atlantic hurricane that formed in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm formed near the Cape Verde Islands on August 4. It moved across the Atlantic Ocean, and it turned northward around Bermuda. The storm lost its name as a tropical cyclone to the southeast of Newfoundland. Irene lasted for 14 days as a tropical system. That is the longest time of any storm of the 2005 season. 

Irene was a hard storm to forecast. The storm almost died out on August 10, but it gained back its strength. Irene reached Category 2 hurricane strength on August 16. Because the storm stayed far away from land, no tropical cyclone warnings were declared. Also, Irene did not cause any bad damage. However, it caused strong waves along the East Coast of the United States. Because of the waves from Irene, a 16-year-old boy drowned after being caught in a rip current near Long Beach, New York. Lifeguards at one beach made over 100 rescues. The name "Irene" was used again in 2011.



Ciliate

The ciliates are a group of protists which have hair-like organelles called cilia.

Ciliates are identical in structure to flagella, but typically shorter and in much larger numbers. They have a different pattern of waving than do flagella. 

Cilia occur in all members of the group (although the peculiar suctoria have them only for part of the life-cycle). They are used for swimming, crawling, attachment, feeding, and sensation.

Apicomplexa

The Apicomplexa are a large group of protists (protozoa) which are parasitic. They have developed some extraordinary adaptations which fit them in their parasitic life. They are all single-celled, they are all parasites of animals, and they all form spores.

They have a unique organelle, a plastid called an apicoplast, and an apical complex structure which gets them into a host's cell. They do not have structures such as flagella or pseudopods except in certain gamete stages. Body movement is by flexing or gliding.

The group were once called the Sporozoa, but this name is now discouraged.

Apicomplexans have complex life cycles, and there is much variation among different apicomplexan groups. Both asexual and sexual reproduction occur. Cell nuclei are haploid.

This is a diverse group including organisms such as coccidia, gregarines, piroplasms, haemogregarines, and malarias. Diseases caused by apicomplexan organisms include:


Most members have a complex life-cycle, with both asexual and sexual reproduction. A host is infected by an active invasion by the parasites. The parasites divide to produce "sporozoites" which enter its cells. Eventually, the cells burst, releasing "merozoites", which infect new cells. Eventually, gametes are produced, and they fuse to create new cysts. There are many variations on this basic pattern, however, and many Apicomplexa have more than one host.

The apical complex includes vesicles which open at the front of the cell. They secrete enzymes that allow the parasite to enter other cells. The tip is surrounded by a band of microtubules, called the "polar ring", and among the Conoidasida there is also a funnel of tubulin proteins called the "conoid".

The presence of alveoli and other traits place the Apicomplexa among a group called the alveolates. Several related flagellates, such as "Perkinsus" and "Colpodella", have structures similar to the polar ring and were formerly included here, but most appear to be closer relatives of the dinoflagellates. They are probably similar to the common ancestor of the two groups.

Another similarity is that many apicomplexan cells contain a single plastid, called the apicoplast, surrounded by either 3 or four membranes. Its functions are thought to include tasks such as lipid and haem biosynthesis. It appears to be necessary for survival. The plastids are thought to have a common origin with the chloroplasts of dinoflagellates, and evidence points to an origin from red algae rather than green.

Dahir of Aror

Raja Dahir ( (Urdu: راجہ داہر) b. 679, d. 712) was a Sindhi Hindu ruler. He was the last Hindu ruler of Sindh and parts of Punjab in what is Pakistan. In the early part of the Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent, Muhammad bin Qasim al-Thaqafi took control of Dahir's kingdom for the Umayyad Caliphate. where Dahir died while defending his kingdom. According to the Chachnama, the Umayyad campaign against Dahir was due to a pirate raid off the coast of the Sindhi coast that resulted in gifts to the Umayyad caliph from the king of Serendib, 



Aconoidasida

The Aconoidasida are a class of apicomplexan parasites. The class has two orders: Haemosporinidae and Piroplasmorida.

David Rosenhan

David L. Rosenhan (1929 – February 6, 2012) was an American psychologist. He was best known for the Rosenhan experiment. This was a study which looked at how valid psychiatry diagnoses were.

Rosenhan got his Bachelor of Arts degree from Yeshiva University. At Columbia University in 1953 he earned his master's degree. Five years later, he earned a Ph.D in psychology. Rosenhan was an expert on psychology and law. 

In 1973 Rosenhan published "On Being Sane in Insane Places". This was one of the most-read pieces of writing in psychology. The article talks about the Rosenhan experiment. The experiment was that eight people with no history of psychopathology would try to get into twelve psychiatric hospitals. All of these people were allowed in, and were diagnosed with either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Psychiatrists then tried to cure the people using psychiatric medicines. All eight were allowed to leave within 7 to 52 days, but only when they had said that they accepted the illness they had been diagnosed with. Later in the study, a research and teaching hospital challenged Rosenhan to run a similar experiment with its own diagnoses and rules for letting people in to the hospital. Psychiatric staff were warned that at least one pseudo-patient might be sent to their hospital. At least one staff member thought that 83 out of the 193 new patients were actors. In fact, Rosenhan sent no actors. The study showed that the ways diagnosis was done was very inaccurate in telling people with mental disorders and people without mental disorders apart. The paper made a lot of controversy. Some people are not sure of how valid and credible the study was, but say that psychiatric diagnoses need to be improved.

Professor Rosenhan worked with the Stanford University Department of Psychology. Later, he became professor emeritus at Stanford University. He died on February 6, 2012, aged 82.

Leniniana

Leniniana is a topic for collecting postage stamps that tell about the life and story of Lenin (1870–1924) or people, places, etc. connected with him. The topic was common in the Soviet Union.



Iranian rial

The rial (IRR") is the name of Iran's currency. It was first introduced in 1798. One toman"' equals 10 rials.

The toman (تومان tumân) is no longer an official unit of Iranian currency, but Iranians usually quote money and prices of goods in tomans. For this purpose, one toman equals 10 rials. 

Pseudomonas

Pseudomonas is a gram-negative bacteria. It is a genus belonging to the Pseudomonadaceae family. There are about 144 species in this genus. Most of the Pseudomonas species are saprotrophic, meaning they release enzymes that break down big substances into small ones. 

Pseudomonas is one of the earliest found bacteria. It was first called 'Bacterium aeruginosm' by Schroter in 1872. However, in 1894, German botanist classified it as "Pseudomonas aeruginosa". In Greek, pseudo means false and monas means “unit”. This bacteria is associated with many chronic infections and is considered dangerous due to its resistance to many antibiotics. There has been an increase in the number of species discovered year by year. In 2013, 10 species have been found and 6 more in the subsequent year. Pseudomonas was well-classified 100 years later by a Canadian scientist, Roger Stanier. The classification was based on the physiological and biochemical properties.

The basic tool which is used to classify Pseudomonas is the 16S rRNA gene. However, it is hard to differentiate closely related Pseudomonas species, thus genes such as atpD, gyrB, rpoB, recA, and rpoD are also used in the taxonomy of Pseudomonas.Using gyrB and rpoD in phylogenetic analysis, Pseudomonas came from two predominant clusters; intrageneric cluster I (IGC I) and intrageneric cluster II (IGC II). 

IGC I consists of two sub clusters, the ‘"Pseudomonas aeruginosa" complex’  comprises of "Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas alcaligenes, Pseudomonas citronellolis, Pseudomonas mendocina, Pseudomonas oleovorans" and "Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes," and the ‘"Pseudomonas stutzeri" complex’, comprises of "Pseudomonas balearica" and "Pseudomonas stutzeri". 

IGC II consists of three subclusters, the ‘"Pseudomonas syringae" complex’, the ‘"Pseudomonas fluorescens" complex’ and the ‘"Pseudomonas putida" complex’.  The ‘"Pseudomonas syringae" complex’ are phytopathogens and pathovars. The former encompasses "Pseudomonas amygdali, Pseudomonas caricapapayae, Pseudomonas cichorii, Pseudomonas ficuserectae" and "Pseudomonas viridiflava" and the latter consists of "Pseudomonas savastanoi" and "Pseudomonas syringae". The ‘"Pseudomonas fluorescens" complex’ is divided into two subpopulations, the ‘"Pseudomonas fluorescens" lineage’ and the ‘"Pseudomonas chlororaphis" lineage’. The ‘"Pseudomonas fluorescens" lineage’ contains "Pseudomonas fluorescens" biotypes A, B and C, "Pseudomonas azotoformans, Pseudomonas marginalis" pathovars, "Pseudomonas mucidolens", "Pseudomonas synxantha" and "Pseudomonas tolaasii", while the ‘"Pseudomonas chlororaphis" lineage’ includes "Pseudomonas chlororaphis, Pseudomonas agarici, Pseudomonas asplenii" and "Pseudomonas corrugata". The ‘"Pseudomonas putida" complex’ comprises of "Pseudomonas putida" and "Pseudomonas fulva".

More than 25 species of Pseudomonas cause diseases in humans. Species such as "Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas maltophilia," and "Pseudomonas putrefaciens" are said to cause opportunistic infections in humans. Opportunistic infections more commonly affect people with weak immune systems compared to the ones with stronger immune system. Only two of the species are known to cause specific disease. These are "Pseudomonas mallei" and "Pseudomonas pseudomallei" which cause glanders and melioidosis respectively. However, the most common species involved in clinical problems is "Pseudomonas aeruginosa". The common clinical problems caused by "Pseudomonas aeruginosa" is shown in the following bullet points.


Pseudomonas strains have been useful in the biotechnology field. The table below shows the Pseudomonas strains and their respective uses.

Giant magnetoresistance

Giant magnetoresistance (GMR) is a very small magnetic effect found in thin layers of iron and other materials. It is used to read and write information in hard drives.

The GMR effect can be measured when a magnet is used to change the flow of electricity. The 2007 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to Albert Fert and Peter Grünberg for the discovery of GMR.

GMR was discovered in layers iron, chrome and ferrite by Peter Grünbergs research team of the Jülich Research Centre (Germany) in 1988. Peter Grünberg owns a patent for the technology. It was also discovered by Albert Ferts research group of the University of Paris-Sud (France) in layers ferrite and chrome. The Fert group were first to see what they thought of as a "large" effect which is why they gave the name "Giant". The Fert group were also first to explain the correct physics of GMR. The discovery was the beginning of the science spintronics. Grünberg and Fert have been given prizes and awards, including the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics, for this discovery and other spintronics work.

In multilayer GMR, two or more magnetic layers are separated by a very thin (about 1 nm) non-magnetic (insulating) layer. Ferrite, a form of iron, is a magnetic layer and chrome is an insulating layer. At certain thickness, the strength of magnetism between the layers becomes easy to measure and adjust. The strength of electrical current between the layers can change by up to 10%.

The GMR effect was first observed in stacks of 10 or more layers.

In spin valve GMR, two magnetic layers are separated by a thin (~3 nm) non-magnetic (insulating) layer. It is possible to measure and adjust the strength of magnetism between these layers.

It is hoped that research into spinning electrons will improve spin valves. 

Materials used in spin valves are copper and an alloy of nickel and iron. 

Spin valve GMR is the most useful sort for hard drives and is tested carefully to meet industry standards.

Granular GMR is an effect found in copper containing grains of cobalt. It is not possible to control the strength of granular GMR in the same manner as Multilayer GMR.

GMR is used in modern hard drives and magnetic sensors. Another use of the GMR effect is in magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM). GMR has begun a new science of electronics called spintronics.

Bill Evans

William John "Bill" Evans (August 16, 1929 – September 15, 1980) was an American jazz piano player. His career lasted 25 years. He was known for playing close groups of chords in his left hand, while playing melodies with his right hand. He was also known for playing in groups that featured him, a bass player, and a drummer. The groups dealt more with interaction and group-improvisation than jazz bands before them.

Link reaction

The Link reaction, also known as pyruvate decarboxylation forms an important link between the metabolic pathways of glycolysis and the citric acid or Krebs cycle.

In eukaryotes, the reaction takes place only inside the mitochondrial matrix; in prokaryotes similar reactions take place in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane.

To summarize:


Acetyl CoA is then ready for use in the Krebs Cycle.

The Link reaction is important as acetyl-CoA is needed for the Krebs cycle to happen.



Rift (geology)

In geology, a rift is caused by tectonic plates in the Earth's lithosphere moving apart. Rifts are usually accompanied by orogeny (mountain building), volcanoes and earthquakes. Rifting often makes a rift valley, which may hold a rift lake. The Great Rift Valley in East Africa is an example.
A rift is the result of the pulling apart or extension of the crust and lithosphere. Mantle upwelling brings hotter asthenosphere up into the colder lithosphere. Sometime it comes out as lava. This rise occurs with the thinning and stretching of the lithosphere.

Yo-Yo Ma

Yo-Yo Ma (born 7 October 1955) is a French-born Chinese American cellist. His family name is “Ma”, so his full Chinese name is “Ma Yo-yo”. Yo-Yo Ma is one of the world’s greatest cellists. He plays many kinds of music, not just classical, and he has performed for three presidents of the United States.

Yo-Yo Ma was born in Paris. His parents were Chinese. His mother, Marina Lu, was a singer, and his father, Hiao-Tsiun Ma, was a professor of music. His family moved to New York when he was four years old. 

Ma began studying violin when he was very small. He also played the viola for a short while, then, at the age of four, he started the cello. He was a child prodigy and began performing to audiences at the age of five. When he was seven he performed for President John F. Kennedy . At the age of eight he appeared on American television in a concert conducted by Leonard Bernstein. By the time he was fifteen, Ma had graduated from Trinity School in New York and appeared as a soloist with the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra playing Tchaikovsky’s 'Variations on a Rococo Theme".

Ma studied at the Juilliard School of Music. His teacher was Leonard Rose. He went to Columbia University and then Harvard University. At one time he had doubts about whether he should continue his studies, but in the 1970s he was inspired by the recordings of Pablo Casals.

By this time he had played with several of the world's great orchestras. His recordings and performances of the "Johann Sebastian Bach: Cello Suites" recorded in 1983 and again in 1994-1997 have been particularly praised. He has also played lots of chamber music, often with the pianist Emanuel Ax whom he had met at the Julliard School of Music.

Ma married in 1977. The couple have two children. They live in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Ma is interested in music from different cultures. He has a group called Silk Road Ensemble which tries to bring together musicians from different countries which are historically linked by the Silk Road. H records on the Sony Classical label.

Yo-Yo Ma has owned several beautiful cellos. The cello called "Domenico Montagnana 1733" cello (nicknamed "Petunia") was made in 1733 in Venice. It is worth more than US$2.5 million. In 1999 he accidentally left it in a taxi but fortunately it was found again. Another of Ma's cellos, the "Davidov Stradivarius", was once owned by Jacqueline du Pré who left it to him when she died.
He also owns a cello made of carbon fiber by the Luis and Clark company of Boston.

Yo-Yo Ma has played for the soundtracks of many famous movies. He also has made over 75 albums, 15 of which are Grammy Award winners.

Ma has appeared in an episode of the animated children's television series, "Arthur" (in which D.W. kept calling him "Yo Ma-Ma") as well as several other television programmes including "The Simpsons". Ma performed a duet with Condoleezza Rice at the presentation of the 2001 National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal Awards. He made a programme about "Bach: Six Suites for Unaccompanied Cello". 

On 11 September, 2002, a year after the attack on the World Trade Center, he played his cello on the site of the building while the first of the names of the dead were read in remembrance. Ma was named Peace Ambassador by the United Nations in January 2006. 

He performed John Williams' "Air and Simple Gifts" at the inauguration ceremony for Barack Obama on January 20, 2009 together with the violinist Itzhak Perlman, the pianist Gabriela Montero and the clarinettist Anthony McGill.

National anthem of Russia

The State Anthem of the Russian Federation is the name of the national anthem of Russia. First used in 2001, the song's music is the same as that of the former State Anthem of the Soviet Union, which was composed by Alexander Alexandrov in 1938. The words were newly written by Sergey Mikhalkov in 2000, who also wrote the words for the Soviet national anthem back in 1943.

What is today the Russian Federation has had several different anthems over the years. The earliest of these, called "Let the Thunder of Victory Rumble!" was used in the late 18th to early 19th century. In 1816, the Russian Empire adopted "The Prayer of the Russians", whose melody was that of the British anthem "God Save the King". This anthem was used until 1833, when a new composition called "God Save the Tsar!" was chosen by Nicholas I, but did not became popular until 1837. Its melody became used in classical music such as Beethoven's Wellington's Victory and Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture.

"God Save the Tsar!" continued to be the national anthem until the February Revolution in March 1917, when an adaptation of the French national anthem, known as the "Worker's Marseillaise", was used for a short time. Later that year, when the October Revolution happened, the Bolsheviks adopted a Russian translation of "The Internationale", which became the national anthem of the Soviet Union when it was founded in 1922. This was replaced by the State Anthem of the Soviet Union with Alexandrov's music and Mikhalkov's lyrics in 1944. The lyrics were removed in 1953 after the death of Joseph Stalin, but a new set of lyrics were added in 1977.

While the republics of the Soviet Union had their own anthems during this time, the Russian SFSR did not, instead using the Soviet national anthem. However, in 1990, the Russian SFSR adopted a composition by Mikhail Glinka, known as "The Patriotic Song" as its state anthem. There were never any official words to this song. After the Soviet Union broke down in 1991, the president of the newly-formed Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, continued to use "The Patriotic Song" as the country's national anthem. When he was replaced by Vladimir Putin in 2000, the new president began to push for the melody of the old Soviet anthem to be brought back. Finally, in December of that year, the State Duma voted in favour of the music of the Soviet anthem, together with new lyrics by Mikhalkov, to be adopted as the national anthem, and the new anthem was performed for the first time during a ceremony at the Great Kremlin Palace just before the New Year.

Because Russia has so many different languages, the anthem has been translated into many of them. Due to the small amount of space, only the anthem's chorus in some of these languages is shown.

Newton's law of universal gravitation

Newton's universal law of gravitation is a physical law that describes the attraction between two objects with mass. It is talked about in Isaac Newton's "Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica". The law is part of classical mechanics. 

The formula is

In this equation:

In SI units, formula_2 is measured in newtons (N), formula_4 and formula_5 in kilograms (kg), formula_6 in meters (m), and the constant formula_3 is approximately equal to .

Campagna

Campagna is a small town in the region of Campania in Italy.

The town, located in a mountainous district, gradually lost importance in the 20th century. All its district offices have been moved to other cities since the 1930s, and the Diocese of Campagna merged with the Archdiocese of Salerno in 1973.

During World War II, Campagna was the site of an internment camp. The Bishop Giuseppe Maria Palatucci turned the camp into a shelter for Italian and foreign Jews, many of them sent there for protection by his nephew Giovanni Palatucci; Giovanni was later honored as a Righteous Among the Nations by the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial.

Denial-of-Service attack

A Denial-of-Service attack (DoS) is when someone arranges for a lot of computers to open a website. This stops everyone else from accessing the website as there is too much traffic flowing to it. People with slower internet connections, such as dial-up, are affected more by attacks.

There are different kinds of DoS attacks:

In the 1990s and early 2000s, many web companies were hit by DoS attacks. For example, Microsoft was affected by DoS attacks in early 2001. Many users were unable to access the Microsoft website and many Microsoft services. On June 10, 2014, Evernote was targeted by a DDoS attack for 24 hours. 

Pat Paulsen

Patrick Layton "Pat" Paulsen (July 6, 1927 – April 24, 1997) was an American comedian and actor. His longest-running role was as a frequent "candidate" for President of the United States.

Paulsen was born in South Bend, Washington. Paulsen had served in the United States Marines during World War II. After the war, he went to college, and worked a variety of jobs (as a salesman, an , a truck driver, and others) before starting a comedy with his brother. After the troupe broke up, Paulsen started performing on his own. He played at many of the same as the Smothers Brothers, before they became famous.

After the Smothers Brothers began a television variety show ("The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour") in 1967, they invited Paulsen to join their regular cast. He wrote for the show, and also appeared on camera in different roles. He began a series of mock editorials, that became very popular, by both poking fun at extremist opinions, and giving people reasons to think and talk about important issues (the First Amendment, gun control, drugs, and other matters). Hundreds of viewers wrote to CBS, who broadcast the "Comedy Hour", to ask for copies of the editorials.

During 1968 (an election year in the United States), Paulsen began a pretend "campaign" for President, and used the campaign to show the humor and irony in American politics. He did many of the things a real candidate would do, making public appearances, giving speeches, granting media interviews, and making his "stand on the issues" well known. When Election Day came, people in many places around the United States really did vote for Paulsen, as a candidate, because they were not satisfied with what the real candidates (Republican Richard M. Nixon, Democrat Hubert Humphrey, Alabama governor George Wallace, and others) promised to do as President.

After "The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour" ended in 1969, Paulsen continued to work as a comedian and actor. Instead of just making people laugh, he often drew their attention to problems in American society, such as pollution, prejudice, and poor government. During the 1970s, he bought the Cherry County Playhouse, a theater in Traverse City, Michigan that showed .

Paulsen sometimes reunited with the Smothers Brothers, and usually staged another pretend campaign every election year. In 1992 he chose singer Tiny Tim as his , to become his Vice President. Paulsen died on April 24, 1997 from pneumonia from complications of brain and colon cancer, during medical treatment in Tijuana, Mexico, he was 69 years old. He is survived by his wife Noma Paulsen.

 

Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In

Laugh-In was an American television series, which ran on NBC from 1968 until 1974. Its hosts were comedians Dan Rowan and Dick Martin. The show's name came from a trend of naming public events with an "-In", such as the Human Be-In of 1967.

Begun as a one-time television , the first "Laugh-In" was so popular that it became a regular show in 1968. Hosts Rowan and Martin dressed in tuxedos, and played to the other performers on the show. Radio host Gary Owens played the show's . Producers George Schlatter and Ed Friendly worked behind the scenes, and did not appear on camera.

"Laugh-In" featured " humor", with most of its comedy based on current events. The show mocked contemporary trends and fashions, and imitated popular styles of the time. Regular features were "the Party", where performers told about current issues in a party setting, ""Laugh-In" Looks at the News", a mock news broadcast, and the "Joke Wall", where the cast ran from door to door in a specially-built wall, and told old jokes. The show also used , including "Sock it to me!", "You bet your bippy!" and "Look that up in your !"

The show featured a large cast of performers, including many who were new to television. These included Goldie Hawn, Arte Johnson, Lily Tomlin, Henry Gibson, Ruth Buzzi, Dave Madden, Joanne Worley, Alan Sues, Chelsea Brown, Judy Carne and others. Several of the performers went on to longtime comedy and acting careers. British actor Jeremy Lloyd and "Hogan's Heroes" cast members Richard Dawson and Larry Hovis also appeared on the show for a time.

Guests on "Laugh-In" included Tiny Tim, The Monkees, Ringo Starr, and other famous singers and actors. Some were veterans of , while others were newly famous, or became famous partly through appearing on the show. Dewey "Pigmeat" Markham, an African-American comedian not known to white audiences, was first imitated on the show by Sammy Davis, Jr., then appeared himself, becoming a surprise hit with the same Judge routine he had played for years on the "chitlin' circuit". ("Here come the Judge!" became another show catchphrase.) Richard M. Nixon appeared in a short segment on the show, when he was campaigning for President of the United States, and some people believed this helped him get elected.

The series became less popular as time went on, and ended in 1974, with the show's producers explaining that they had "run out of things to parody" (make fun of). A reunion special in 1979 led to a short revival of the show as a "summer replacement" series, featuring guests like Robin Williams.

Very High Bitrate Digital Subscriber Line

VDSL or VHDSL (Very High Bitrate DSL) is a DSL technology providing faster data movement. This works over a single flat untwisted or twisted pair of copper wires. These fast speeds mean that VDSL can move data for digital television, as well as telephone services (Voice over IP) and Internet. It can do all these things on a single connection, using existing wiring used for POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service).


Red algae

Red algae are members of the phylum Rhodophyta. This is a large group of aquatic algae with about 6000 species. They have reddish phycobilin pigments—phycoerythrin and phycocyanin. 

The red algae are a distinct group. They have eukaryotic cells without flagella and centrioles. Their chloroplasts lack external endoplasmic reticulum. These chloroplasts have unstacked (stroma) thylakoids. 

Phycobiliproteins are accessory pigments, which give them their red color. What these pigments do is the same as what chlorophyll does: absorb sunlight as energy, which is then used to fuel the building of organic compounds.

Red algae store sugars as a type of starch outside their plastids. 

Most red algae are multicellular, macroscopic, marine, and reproduce sexually. The usual red algal life history is an alternation of generations with three generations rather than two.

Chloroplasts evolved following an endosymbiotic event between an ancestral, photosynthetic cyanobacterium and an early eukarytoic phagotroph.

Most species grow near tropical and subtropical shores below the low-tide mark. A few are found in fresh water. Red algae is used to make the food "Nori".

2005 Azores subtropical storm

The 2005 Azores subtropical storm was a type of tropical cyclone in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm was not named by the National Hurricane Center, because it was not found until after the season ended. The storm formed in the Atlantic Ocean, and it became a "subtropical cyclone" on October 4. The storm did not last a long time. It passed over the Azores, and it stopped being a subtropical cyclone on October 5. What was left of the storm went on to become Hurricane Vince. After the hurricane season ended, the National Hurricane Center checked to make sure they did not miss any storms during the year. Some forecasters found this storm, which was not noticed while it was active. 

The system formed from a weather system to the west of the Canary Islands on September 28. The weather system gained strength over the next few days. On October 3, it became a type of low pressure system. Thunderstorms around the storm began to become more active, and it then became a type of cyclone that is called a "subtropical depression".
At about the same time, the depression turned towards the northeast and gained strength. It became a subtropical "storm", which is stronger than a subtropical "depression". The storm gained a bit more strength later that day. It then moved across the Azores, and began to weaken. The storm weakened slightly as it moved to the north-northeast. The storm died out on October 5. What was left of the storm later became Subtropical Storm Vince.

High winds were reported in parts of the Azores because of the storm. The strongest winds were on Santa Maria Island, where there was a gust of 59 mph (94 km/h). Ponta Delgada also saw 52 mph (85 km/h) wind gusts. There was no damage and there were no deaths. The storm was not said to be a subtropical storm until the National Hurricane Center found it on April 10, 2006. Every year, the National Hurricane Center checks to make sure they did not miss any storms during the past tropical storm season. If the storm was found when it was active, it would have been named "Tammy".

The Sobig worm is a large emailing worm that sent itself to any email addresses with file extensions like .dbx, .eml, .hlp, .htm, .html, .mht, .wab, and .txt. The worm often used an email that includes "Re:" to seem as if people were being replied to from someone. The user would then open the email and click on the attachment, running the worm and downloading it on to their computer.

The worm was first found on August 18, 2003. After the infection had started, the worm tried to connect to the Internet to get to updates from 20 different internet servers on August 20. However, security officials were able to cut off and shut down the servers. The worm had a shut off date set for September 10, 2003.

At the height of the infection, the Sobig worm made up one in seventeen emails sent over the internet. The Sobig worm created over 1 million copies of itself for the rest of 2003.

Cloud Cult

Cloud Cult is an indie rock band from Minneapolis, Minnesota that is led by singer and songwriter Craig Minowa. Their name came from the old sayings of the Native Americans. 

The band was made in 1995, when Minowa got other musicians together to help out with some of his solo music, or music made by himself. The band's early music was liked by many record labels. The labels made many offers to sell Cloud Cult's music, but the band decided to self-publish instead, which means that they make their albums themselves without the help of a company. As the band became more popular and started playing live more often, Connie Minowa and Scott West started painting onstage during shows.

In 1997, Craig Minowa started Earthology Records on his organic farm. The new record company now sells the bands' music. 

The band's newest album, "Feel Good Ghosts (Tea-Partying Through Tornadoes)" was released on April 8, 2008. The album is their most popular album yet. Also in 2008, a documentary about the band was made.

After the album was released, Craig Minowa said that it might be the last Cloud Cult album ever. The band is currently taking a break, so the members can focus on their families. 

In October of 2008, the band had a song in an animated Esurance commercial. The band is shown playing their instruments while floating on clouds. After making the commercial, the band put a few songs on Esurance's website. The songs are available to freely download.




The Aristocats

The Aristocats is a 1970 American-French animated musical adventure-romantic comedy movie. It was produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by Buena Vista Distribution. It is the 20th Disney animated movie. The movie is based on a story by Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe. It is about a family of aristocratic cats. They are kidnapped by their greedy butler, Edgar. Edgar wants to gain the fortune that the cats' owner has left to them in her will. An alley cat named Thomas O'Malley helps them make their way back home. O'Malley also helps them defeat Edgar. In the end, O'Malley becomes a part of the family. The movie was directed by Wolfgang Reitherman. It features the voices of Eva Gabor, Hermione Baddeley, Phil Harris, Dean Clark, Sterling Holloway, Scatman Crothers, and Roddy Maude-Roxby.

In 1962, "The Aristocats" began as an original script for a two-part live-action episode of "Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color". It was developed by writers Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe and producer Harry Tytle. Following two years of re-writes, Walt Disney said that the project would be better made as an animated movie. The project was placed in turnaround as "The Jungle Book" continued production. When "The Jungle Book" was nearly complete, Disney appointed Ken Anderson to develop preliminary work on "The Aristocats". It was the last movie project to be approved by Walt Disney before his death on December 15, 1966.

"The Aristocats" was released on December 11, 1970. It received positive reception and was a box office success.

The movie takes place in Paris in 1910. A mother cat named Duchess (Eva Gabor) and her three kittens, Marie (Liz English), Berlioz (Dean Clark) and Toulouse (Gary Dubin), are going to receive their owner's (Hermione Baddeley) fortune when she dies. But Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby), their English butler, does not like this and plans to send the cats away.

He places sleeping tablets in their dinner. At night, he plans on dropping them off in the countryside. Two hound dogs, Napoleon (Pat Buttram) and Lafayette (George Lindsey), attack him, and the cats are now stranded.

In the morning, they meet an alley cat named Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris). He helps them on their way back home. He even lets them stay at his "pad" (the place where he and his "gang", or friends, stay).

They finally make their way back home, but Edgar re-catches them in a sack and plans to send them to Timbuktu, Africa. O'Malley, Scat Cat (Scatman Crothers) and his gang, Roquefort the Mouse (Sterling Holloway), and Frou-Frou the Horse (Nancy Kulp) all fight Edgar. Roquefort frees Duchess and the kittens. In the end, Edgar is kicked into the trunk, locked inside, and sent to Timbuktu himself. Madame Adelaide's will is re-written to not include Edgar and instead include O'Malley. She also starts a charity foundation. This foundation gives a home to all the creatures in Paris.


"The Aristocats" was released on VHS in Europe on January 1, 1990. It was first released on VHS in North America in the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection series on April 24, 1996.

In January 2000, Walt Disney Home Video launched the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection, with "The Aristocats" re-released on VHS and DVD on April 4, 2000.

E number

An E number is a number code which is used for a food additive. E numbers are usually found on food labels in the European Union. The numbering scheme follows that of the International Numbering System (INS) as determined by the Codex Alimentarius committee. Not all of the INS additives are approved for use in the European Union. The 'E' prefix stands for Europe. In the UK and Ireland, the term "E-number" is used as a pejorative term for artificial food additives. Products may be promote themselves as "free of E-numbers" even though some of the ingredients (e.g. bicarbonate of soda) do have such a code.

E numbers are also encountered on food labeling in other parts of the world, including the GCC, Australia, New Zealand and Israel. They are increasingly (though still rarely) found on North American packaging, especially in Canada. The "E" prefix is omitted in Australia and New Zealand, and the term "E-Number" unknown.

Usually, the number has 3 digits. E numbers between E100 and E199 are colors. E numbers between E200 and E299 are preservatives. E numbers between E300 and E399 are antioxidants and acidity regulators. E numbers between E400 and E499 are thickeners, stabilizers and emulsifiers. E numbers between E500 and E599 are pH regulators. E numbers between E600 and E699 are flavor enhancers. E numbers between E700 and E799 are antibiotics. E numbers between E900 and E999 are glazing agents, gases, and sweeteners.

Homo rudolfensis

Homo rudolfensis is a fossil hominin species discovered by Bernard Ngeneo, a member of a team led by anthropologist Richard Leakey and zoologist Meave Leakey in 1972, at Koobi Fora on the east side of Lake Rudolf (now Lake Turkana) in Kenya. The scientific name "Homo rudolfensis" was proposed in 1986 by V. P. Alexeev for the specimen Skull 1470 (KNM ER 1470). Skull 1470 has an estimated age of 1.9 million years.

George Wallace

George Corley Wallace (August 25, 1919 – September 13, 1998) was an American politician. He served as Governor of Alabama from 1963 to 1967. He ran for President of the United States three times (1964, 1968, 1976).

Wallace was born in Clio, Alabama. He began his long political career at the age of 33 after running for county judge.

When Wallace was running for president, he was shot, which made him paralyzed for the rest of his life. He is known for having different views on segregation, because he supported segregation. He was a Democrat.

Wallace died at the age of 79 from sepsis caused by a spinal infection after 26 years of being in a wheelchair.

Wallace was born George Corley Wallace on August 25, 1919 in Clio, Alabama. He studied at University of Alabama. He grew up in a lower-middle-class family. As a young man, he was an amateur boxer, where he fought as a bantamweight.

Wallace was a very short man for his entire life, and as an adult was about 5'2" (1.57m)

He served four terms as governor of Alabama, and also ran for President of the United States several times, during the 1960s and 1970s. Wallace was a longtime supporter of segregation; a policy that did not allow African-Americans to go to the same schools or many of the same public places as white people. In 1963 he stood in a schoolhouse door to stop black students from going to the school (which would have integrated the school). In a speech, he said he would support "segregation today, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever". He was a controversial figure. Some people saw him as a man who spoke up for the poor and was an outspoken populist. Others saw him as a terrible person, a white supremacist who supported violence.

In time, he changed his views, and said that he was sorry to African-Americans and other people hurt by segregation. He promoted black equality in his last term as Governor. Despite this, he is still an icon of racism today and many people think of him as one of the most evil people in American history.

During the 1972 presidential campaign, Wallace was shot five times by someone who wanted to assassinate him, Arthur Bremer. He got a permanent injury to his spine. He could no longer walk, and spent the rest of his life using a wheelchair.

After his last term as governor, he began speaking in public places (including churches).

Wallace was married to Laurleen Wallace until her death. He then married to Corelia Wallace until they divorced. Then he was married to Lisa Taylor until they divorced. He had four children.

The Lynyrd Skynyrd song "Sweet Home Alabama" has the line "In Birmingham they love the Governor / Boo Boo Boo / Now we all did what we could do / if watergate does not bother me / does your conscience bother you now tell me true." Even though Wallace is not mentioned by name, the line clearly refers to him, and members of the band have confirmed this and have said they disliked Wallace.

Gary Sinise played him in the film "George Wallace".

A tunnel on Interstate 10 in Alabama has been named the George Wallace Memorial Tunnel.
Wallace died on September 13, 1998 in Montgomery, Alabama from sepsis complicated by a spinal infection, aged 79. He was buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Montgomery.


Homo ergaster

Homo ergaster, also called "African "Homo erectus"", is an extinct chronospecies of "Homo" which lived in eastern and southern Africa during the early Pleistocene, between 1.8 million and 1.3 million years ago.

There is still disagreement on the subject of the classification and ancestry of "H. ergaster". However, it is now widely accepted as the direct ancestor of Asian "Homo erectus", "Homo neanderthalensis", "Homo heidelbergensis", and hence "Homo sapiens".

It is one of the earliest members of the genus "Homo", possibly ancestral to, or sharing a common ancestor with, "Homo erectus". Some paleoanthropologists consider "H. ergaster" is just the African variety of "H. erectus". There are Asian fossils of "H. erectus", which was the first human species to spread from Africa. 

The name "ergaster" means "workman", in reference to the Acheulean hand axe industry developed by the species. The species' period in eastern and southern Africa coincided with the first part of the Pleistocene, the cooling of the global climate and the start of the ice ages. These events would have shrunk the rainforests in Africa, and expanded the savannahs and open forests to which "ergaster" was well suited.

Lolcat

A lolcat is a common Internet meme which is made up of picture of a cat with a funny caption. The caption is usually in bad English that makes fun of Internet slang. like chez and haz. "Lolcat" is a mix of the words lol and cat. Lol is internet slang for "laughing out loud." A different word for lolcat is "cat macro" because it is a type of image macro. The first time the media talked about lolcats was when Time Magazine covered them in an article. The article said that lolcats and other things like them are becoming rare. It also said that they have a "distinct...Usenet feel to [them]." 

Lolcats are pictures of cats doing something out of the ordinary quoted words in big, sans serif letters (letters without feet). Sometimes the picture is changed with a computer to make it funnier.

There are lots of different lolcat memes, like ceiling cat, monorail cat, and 'i eated a butter' cat

Cupressus macrocarpa

Cupressus macrocarpa (Monterey Cypress, Macrocarpa; syn. "Callitropsis macrocarpa" (Hartw.) D.P.Little) is a species of cypress endemic to the central coast of California. In the wild, the species is confined to two small populations, near Monterey and Carmel. These two small populations represent what was once a very large forest on the west coast. The surviving trees from this forest are as old as 2000 years.

Tropical Storm Cristobal (2002)

Tropical Storm Cristobal was a cyclone that formed in August of 2002. It stayed away from land for most of its life. However, when it died out, what was left of the storm caused rain and wind on Bermuda. It also caused stormy seas that caused three people to drown near Long Island. No severe damage happened.

A cyclone formed on August 5. At that time, it was located about 175 miles (280 km/h) to the east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. The storm then moved towards the southeast. On August 6, the rain and clouds around the storm began to get weaker. However, the storm gained enough strength to be named Tropical Storm Cristobal on August 6.

The tropical storm was still moving towards the southeast when it became Cristobal. On August 7, it turned to the east. Cristobal then reached its highest strength. It began to weaken after that. Early on August 9, Tropical Storm Cristobal merged with another weather system, when it was located about 350 miles (560 km) to the southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. What was left of the storm passed near Newfoundland on August 10. It fully died near Greenland on August 14.

Cristobal stayed mostly away from land while it was a tropical cyclone. However, what was left of it after it died out brought rain and wind to Bermuda. A wind gust of 45 mph (72 km/h) happened at the Bermuda International Airport. 2.78 inches (71 mm) of rain fell in 24 hours. This rain was partly because of Cristobal. Cristobal also caused rip currents and 4 foot (1.2 m) waves along the south shore of Long Island, New York. Three people drowned in the rip currents. Two ships in the ocean reported high winds because of the storm.

Captain Moonlite

Andrew George Scott (1842 — January 20, 1880) was a famous Australian bushranger, known as Captain Moonlite, sometimes spelt "Moonlight". He lived in Victoria and was different from other bushrangers. There are a lot of stories and legends told about Captain Moonlight.

Scott was born in Rathfriland, County Down, Ireland, in 1842. His father was an Anglican clergyman. Scott had a good education, good manners, and had read the Bible. He left Ireland and went to London. 

After hearing about the gold rushes in Australia he made his way to Victoria. He went to New Zealand and took part in the Maori Wars in 1861. He was speared in the leg, which left him with a limp. At the end of the war, he went back to Melbourne and began to train as a clergyman in the Church of England.

He began work with the church in the Bacchus Marsh area. He lived at the small town of Mount Egerton. From there he went travelled around, visiting people, and doing church work.

At 1.00 am, Andrew came to the bank with his face covered, and armed with a gun, went into the house of the Mount Egerton bank manager, Mr. Brunn. The robber forced Brunn to walk down to the school and write a note, which said, “Captain Moonlite has stuck me up and robbed the bank.” They went back to the bank where Moonlight tied Brunn up before taking all the money. 

In the morning, the teacher, Mr. Simpson, found the note. He ran to the bank and untied Brunn. Brunn told the police that the man was the preacher, Andrew Scott. Scott said it was a lie, and told the police it was a plan by Brunn and Simpson to steal money from the bank. Everyone believed the preacher, and the police arrested Brunn and Simpson for robbing the bank.

Scott left Mount Egerton and told people he was going to go to the South Pacific. He was the main witness in the bank robbery. When he left, the police had to drop the charges against Brunn and Simpson. He bought a boat, the "Swallow", and sailed out of Sydney with a group of rich young men. He just passed through the Sydney Heads when a police steam launch caught up with him and made him go back. He had paid for the boat with a bad cheque. He was sent to gaol (jail) for 18 months...,

As soon as he was let out of gaol in Sydney, he was arrested for the Mount Egerton robbery. The police put him in the new Ballarat Gaol to wait for his trial. He was able to make a hole into the next cell. With help from another prisoner, Dermoodie, they overpowered the guard and locked him in the cell. They let all the other prisoners out of their cells. They stood on each other's backs and shoulders to get to the top of the gaol wall. 

Using a rope made from blankets tied together, the prisoners climbed the wall and escaped. Within one week, the police got back all the prisoners. The court gave Scott ten years in gaol for the bank robbery and one year for escaping from Ballarat. He was locked up in Pentridge Gaol. Scott behaved in gaol. After he was let out of gaol, he spoke at meetings about prison reform.

On November 18, 1879, a group of bushrangers led by Captain Moonlight, held up the Wantabadgery station (farm), east of Wagga Wagga. They stayed there for three days and held up all the people travelling along the road. They held about 30 people prisoner. One person was able to escape and tell the police. Two groups of police from Wagga Wagga and Gundagai went to the farm. 

After a lot of shooting, the bushrangers left and the police chased them through the bush. A bushranger, Gus Wernicke, aged 15, was shot and died in great pain. A policeman, Constable Bowen was badly hurt, and died a few days later. Captain Moonlight gave himself up to the police. The police captured the rest of the gang a few days later.

The police charged the bushrangers with the murder of Bowen. In court at Darlinghurst, Sydney, Scott tried to take the blame for the crime. He wanted the lives of his friends saved. Captain Moonlight, and gang member, Rogan, were hanged on January 20, 1880. In a letter from prison, Scott asked to buried next to his friend, James Nesbitt. In 1995 he was reburied at Gundagai next to gang members Gus Wernicke and James Nesbitt. A death mask was made of Scott by Walter McGill. This mask is now in the Justice and Police Museum, New South Wales.

The State Library of Victoria has a drawing of Scott made in November, 1879, in its collection. This can be seen on line. Artist Patrick William Marony painted a picture in 1894 of the gang (Scott, Bennett, Rogan, Nesbit and Williams), which he called "The Moonliters". It is kept in the National Library of Australia and can be seen online.

Barrel organ

A barrel organ plays music by using turning a barrel, with notes decided by an arrangement of pins. It is very similar to a simple music box where the pins pluck a metal harp. With a barrel organ, the pins in the barrel lift "keys" that open valves that let air from the bellows to play the pipes. 

The barrel organ is sometimes wrongly called a hurdy gurdy, which is a string instrument. Barrel organs come in many different sizes from hand carried ones to large sizes carried on a wagon or trailer. Usually each barrel had a number of tunes on it, and the tune could be changed to different selection by lifting an indexing pin and sliding the barrel to the next index position. Even a small hand carried organ could play six or eight tunes. Stationary barrel organs, built into large houses or churches, were larger pipe organs, and could play longer, and more serious music. Some had different barrels or revolving barrel changers, which meant they did not need an organist to play them, and had a larger selection of music. Organs built in a church, allowed people to sing, accompanied by organ. Some of the only organ music composed by Mozart, was supposedly written for a barrel organ built into a clock.

Jack Donahue

Jack Donahue (1804 — 1 September, 1830), sometimes called John Donohue, was a famous Australian bushranger. With the exception of Ned Kelly, there have been more songs, poems and stories about him than any other bushranger. He quickly became a folk hero. Governor Ralph Darling told hotel owners they would have their hotels closed if they allowed people to sing songs about Donahue.

Jack Donahue was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1804. He was in trouble with the police for his political activities to gain independence for Ireland. In 1824, he was found guilty of “intent to commit a felony”. This means he was going to do something wrong, but he had not done it yet. He was sent to Sydney on the convict ship "Ann and Amelia", which arrived on 2 January, 1825. He was sent to work for a Mr. Pagan at Parramatta. He was soon in trouble and put to work on a road gang. Major West, at Quaker’s Hill, employed Donahue to look after his pigs.

With two other men, George Kilroy and Bill Smith, he held up some carts on the Richmond Road. The police soon caught them and the court sentenced them to death. As he was being taken back to gaol (jail) in Sydney he escaped. The government offered a reward of £20 for his capture.

In August 1828, Donahue and a gang of eight robbed houses south of Bathurst. A police group nearly captured Donahue near Goulburn. They shot at the gang, and killed several gang members. Donahue escaped and was not seen for several months.

He next appeared in the Nepean River valley around the towns of Liverpool, Penrith, Windsor, Parramatta and Liberty Plains. They robbed the Reverend Samuel Marsden near Windsor. Donahue was working with a man known as “Darky” Underwood, and an escaped convict Jack Walmsley. The government increased the reward to £50.

In April 1830, Governor Ralph Darling made a special law to try to stop bushranging. The police could arrest anyone, enter and search houses without having to have a warrant. There were many stories, some people said Donahue and Underwood had gone to New Zealand, others said they had been killed by the aborigines. On 22 May, 1830, Donahues' gang held up the famous explorer, Charles Sturt. Donahue recognized Sturt and told the others to let him go.

On 1 September, 1830, a group of police and soldiers searching for Donahue found him near a creek at Bringelly. Donahue shouted at them to try to capture him. Private John Muckleston fired his rifle and pistol, hitting Donahue in the neck and forehead. He died soon afterward. His body was taken to Sydney. The surveyor and explorer, Sir Thomas Mitchell, drew a picture of Donahue. This is the only known picture of him.

Walmlsey was shot and killed soon after. Gang member Bill Webber was caught and hanged. Darky Underwood was shot and killed in 1832.

There are many songs and poems about the life of Jack Donahue. These include:

Frederick Ward (bushranger)

Frederick Ward, also known as “"Captain Thunderbolt"”, was an Australian bushranger. He lived in northern New South Wales. Some people thought he was like Robin Hood, who robbed from the rich to help the poor.

Ward was born Windsor, New South Wales in 1835. His father, Michael Ward, had been sent to Australia as a convict in 1815. Fred was one of eleven children. He was arrested in 1856 for selling 50 stolen horses, and sent to prison on Cockatoo Island for ten years. After four years he was given a ticket of leave which meant he was able to leave the gaol as long as he reported to the police every three months.

Ward went to the Mudgee area to work. There he met a girl named Mary Ann Bugg who had a convict father and aboriginal mother. Mary Ann fell pregnant soon afterwards. Ward took her back to her father's farm near Dungog and did not report to the Mudgee police on time. His ticket of leave was cancelled. When he reached the Mudgee police station, he was also arrested for stealing the horse he was riding. He was sent back to Cockatoo Island to finish his six years in gaol plus another three for the stolen horse. 

On 11 September 1863, he and Fred Britten escaped from gaol. They swam from Cockatoo Island and headed north to the New England district in north-east New South Wales. The government put up a reward of £25 for Ward’s capture. Late in October 1863, they robbed a woman at Gostwyck Hut, near Armidale, and stole a shotgun and some bacon. A few days later they were seen by the police near Thunderbolt's Rock. In the gunfight that followed Ward was shot in the back of the left knee. The two bushrangers split up soon afterwards. 

In December 1863, Ward tried to take money from the toll keeper on the road between Maitland and Rutherford. There were only a few shillings in the cash box. Ward took the money but later gave it back. As he left, he told the toll keeper that his name was "Captain Thunderbolt". He then went into the Spread Eagle Inn (hotel) and asked for food. When he asked for his bill, the owner, Mrs. Byrne, told him that there was no charge. He replied that since she was so nice, he was not going to rob her. The police began to search for him but he managed to escape. 

In 1864, Ward and Mary Ann lived quietly in the north-western plains near Bourke. Early in 1865 he joined up with three other men and formed his first gang. His three companions were McIntosh, Thomas Hogan (also known as The Bull), and a youth called John Thompson. They robbed travellers and stations near Collarenebri. A group of police from Bourke followed their tracks and found their camp in the bush. The gang escaped but Mary Ann and her two children were captured by the police. They started to take her to Bourke but she pretended she was having a baby and they left her at a nearby station. Ward went to the station and rescued his family, and took gunpowder and food. Ward and his first gang broke up after young Thompson was shot and nearly killed in April 1865 at Millie near Moree. Mary Ann was arrested again in 1866 and also in 1867 but she was soon released from prison because of support from the community. 

Late in 1865, Ward formed his second bushranging gang with Patrick Kelly and Jemmy the Whisperer. They robbed as far south as 
Quirindi, Currabubula and Carroll. At Carroll they had another shoot-out with the police in December 1865 where a trooper was shot in the arm. The gang split up early in January 1866. 

Ward had another quiet year in 1866. Early in 1867 he took on another young accomplice, Thomas Mason. They carried out robberies from near Scone as far north as the Queensland border. Mason was captured by the police in September 1867. Later that year, Ward and Mary Ann separated. Mary Ann lived for the rest of her life at Mudgee where she died in 1905.

In 1868 Ward took on another young accomplice, William Monckton, and they committed many robberies in northern New South Wales. They separated in December 1868 and soon afterwards Monckton was captured by the police. Ward did not have any other accomplices. Some claim that Thunderbolt was involved in about 80 robberies and stole about £20,000, but his takings were much smaller than that. 

On 25 May 1870 the police at Uralla were told that Thunderbolt was robbing travellers at Blanch's Royal Oak Inn, near Thunderbolt's Rock Constable Alexander Binney Walker chased after Ward on horseback for six or seven miles until they reached Kentucky Creek, south-west of Uralla. Ward jumped off his horse and began swimming across the creek. Constable Walker shot Thunderbolt’s horse, then he shot and killed Ward himself. Ward was later buried at Uralla. 

While there have been stories that it was Ward's brother William who was killed, these stories are easily disproven.

Thunderbolt's Rock and Blanch's Royal Oak Inn were added to New South Wales State Heritage List in July 2012. This listing will protect the site which are now important places for tourists who come to the area. The site of his death at Kentucky Creek, and his grave, have also been added to the Heritage List.


Polish literature

Almost no Polish literature remains before Christianisation in the 10th century. Polish literature was written in the Latin language during the Middle Ages (there are only several Polish language texts from that times).

The Polish language was accepted as equal to Latin after the Renaissance for literature.

Jan Kochanowski was a leading poet of European Renaissance literature in the 16th century.

Polish writers were inspired by Western European literature but they had their own ideas and trends too. Those trends were coming to Poland because of noble people's travells and political contacts but they were becoming popular some time later then in other countries.

Polish Baroque literature had to trends: elitary one (Jan Andrzej Morsztyn, Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski, Daniel Naborowski) and the other one, created by usual nobles (Jan Chryzostom Pasek).

In times of Enlightenment Polish literature was influenced by France. Poland-Lithuania was very weak country and needed political changes. Literature was mainly about society and state, not about love or religion.

In 19th century Poland was not independent. From 1822 to 1863 there was Romanticism in Polish literature. Romantic poets include Adam Mickiewicz who wrote "Pan Tadeusz" epic in 1834, Juliusz Słowacki and Zygmunt Krasiński.

After failed anti-Russian uprising in 1863 Romanticism ended in Poland.

Several Polish novelists have won the Nobel prize. Henryk Sienkiewicz won in 1905. He wrote dramatized versions of famous events in Polish history. Władysław Reymont won a Nobel prize in 1924. He wrote the novel "Chłopi".

Stanisław Lem is famous science fiction author in the modern era. His "Solaris" novel was made twice into a feature film.

Motion of Confidence

A Motion of Confidence is a motion of support proposed by a government in a parliament or other assembly of elected representatives to give the members a chance to register their confidence in a government. The motion is passed or rejected by means of a parliamentary vote. Governments often propose a Motion of confidence to replace a Motion of no confidence proposed by the opposition.

Defeat of a Motion of Confidence in a parliamentary democracy generally requires one of two actions: the resignation of the government, or a request for a parliamentary dissolution and the calling of a General Election.

In Italy the Constitution provides only the motion of confidence and that of not-confidence. but this does not apply to rules for amending the Constitution.

Nevşehir

Nevşehir is a city in the center of Turkey, in Asia Minor.

Coca

Coca is a plant in the family Erythroxylaceae, native to north-western South America. The plant plays a significant role in traditional Andean culture. Coca leaves contain cocaine alkaloids, a basis for the drug cocaine, which is a powerful stimulant. Today the plant has many uses, including traditional use by Andean cultures to flavoring Coca-Cola products to use as an anesthetic.

Coca has been cultivated by Andean cultures for thousands of years. Traditionally people would chew the leaf or soak it in hot water to make tea in order to get a small energy boost. Coca was introduced to Europe in the 16th century. After its stimulating effects were described by a European doctor in the 19th century, people began to refine the leaves to get cocaine. As people began to learn more about cocaine it began to be banned in many countries. In 1961 the United Nations classified the coca leaf as a narcotic even though studies had shown the leaf itself was non-addictive. This has led the United States to pressure coca-growing countries such as Peru and Bolivia to stop growing coca entirely. These countries have responded by fighting the 1961 decision, trying to remove the coca plant from the list.

Skillet

Skillet was an American Grammy-nominated christian rock band from Memphis, Tennessee. The band formed in 1996.


Skillet formed in 1996 with two members: John Cooper, former vocalist for Tennessee progressive rock band Seraph, and Ken Steorts, former guitarist for Urgent Cry. The two bands met through touring together, but those bands disbanded soon after, so John and Ken's pastor encouraged them to form their own band as a side-project. Coming from different styles of rock music, they decided to name the experiment Skillet. After, Trey McClurkin joined the band as a temporary drummer. Skillet was only together for a month when they received interest from major Christian record label ForeFront Records. In 1996 they released a self-titled debut "Skillet". It was well-received, and the trio continued to write new material as they toured the United States. One topic that comes up often among fans and the band itself, is the name 'Skillet'. John Cooper, the lead vocalist, explains that it was a joke at first. Each starting band member was already in a separate band, and all decided to start a side project. Since each other band had a different sound and style to it, the side project was said to be like putting all of those styles in a big skillet to come up with something unique, hence the band name 'Skillet'. The band name is still somewhat of a joke between the band members, especially Cooper, who claims to still not like the title.

Skillet recorded their follow-up album throughout 1997, titled "Hey You, I Love Your Soul", which was released in April 1998. Their second effort was a change in style from the band's first release. With this release, Skillet would abandon their post-grunge approach for a lighter alternative rock and style. His wife Korey was enlisted soon after to play keyboards live in order to alleviate John's live performance duties.

Shortly before the band began recording for their third album, "Invincible", Steorts left the band to be with his family and launch Visible Music College, a modern music ministry college located in Memphis, Kevin Haaland joined the band as their new guitarist, and Korey Cooper joined the band permanently and played keyboards for the recording of "Invincible". Because of this change, the musical style on "Invincible" changed to a more electronic sound. Soon after the release of "Invincible" in 2000, Trey McClurkin parted ways with Skillet, and Lori Peters filled the drummer's position.

In late 2000 (several months after "Invincible" was released), The band released the worship album, and fourth album overall, "Ardent Worship". The band kept much of their sound from "Invincible" on their next studio album "Alien Youth". With little time between touring and recording.

On May 25, 2004, "Collide" was released by Ardent Records and Lava Records. The album was nominated for "Best Rock Gospel Album" in 2005. "Collide" was yet another musical shift for the band.Citing P.O.D. as inspiration for the musical shift on "Collide", Cooper said, "Well I'm one of these song writers, everything I hear goes through my John Cooper filter of what I like and what I don't like.

Great Sphinx

The Great Sphinx is at Giza near Cairo in Egypt. It sits in a depression to the south of the pyramid of the Pharaoh Khafre (Chephren) at the west bank of the Nile River. The Sphinx is a stone sculpture of a creature with a human head and a lion's body. The greatest monumental sculpture in the ancient world, its body is 200 feet (60m) long and 65 feet (20m) tall. Its face is 13 feet (4m) wide. 

It is the oldest known monumental sculpture in Egypt. It is thought to have been built by ancient Egyptians of the Old Kingdom in the reign of the Pharaoh Khafre (c. 2558–2532 BC). 

The Great Sphinx does not appear in any known inscription of the Old Kingdom. There are no inscriptions anywhere describing its construction or its original purpose. In the New Kingdom, the Sphinx was called "Hor-em-akhet" (English: Horus of the Horizon), and the pharaoh Thutmose IV (1401–1391 or 1397–1388 BC) referred to it in his "Dream Stele".

The purpose of the Sphinx is not known. Some archaeologists assume that it was a memorial to a Pharaoh or that it functioned as some sort of talisman or guardian god. Other scholars believe the Sphinx as an astronomical observation device that marked the position of the rising sun on the day of the spring equinox in the time of Leo the Lion.

The statue is eroding today because of wind and humidity and the smog from Cairo. Attempts to restore it have often caused more harm than good. Present attempts at restoration are under the control of the Supreme Council of Antiquities' archaeologists. They are working to drain away underground water.

Kingdom of Ireland

The Kingdom of Ireland () was a country in Western Europe. It was created by King Henry VIII of England by an act of the Irish Parliament in 1541. It had been a colony previously. It was subservient to England partially because of a law passed by the Irish Parliament during Henry VII's reign called Poynings's law which was sponsored by Sir Edward Poynings the Lord Deputy and gave the English Parliament power to veto Irish legislation. It was abolished in 1801 when it joined the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Its lands are now part of two states. These states are the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. The lands in the United Kingdom have the name Northern Ireland.

Xylophone

A xylophone is a musical instrument that is part of the percussion family. It belongs to the group which is often called "pitched percussion" or tuned percussion because it can play different pitches and is a different way of expressing the sound that it creats. (notes). Xylophones have bars which are made of wood. People play the xylophone by hitting the bars with a mallet (a kind of drum stick). Each piece of wood is a different length, so they play different notes when they are hit. The bars are arranged like the keys of a piano. Underneath the bars there are long tubes, called resonators, which make the sound last longer.

The modern orchestral xylophone developed from xylophones found in Africa and Asia. It came as a folk instrument to countries in Central Europe. It was first used in an orchestra by Humperdinck in his opera "Hansel and Gretel". It was also used by Saint-Saëns in his "Danse macabre" where it is supposed to sound like a skeleton, and in his "Carnival of the Animals" where it is supposed to sound like fossils.

The xylophone is usually played so that the music sounds an octave higher than written. Because the sound is always very short the xylophone is often used for short solo tunes which are fast and dry.

The marimba is a kind of xylophone which has a softer sound and more bars, especially low notes. It is not often used in older orchestra music.

Xylophones and marimbas are usually played with two mallets, but it is possible for good players to play with four (two in each hand).

Pendulum clock

A pendulum clock is a clock that uses a pendulum, a swinging weight, as its timekeeping element. It was invented in 1656 by Christiaan Huygens. From the year 1656 until the 1930s, the pendulum clock was the world's most accurate way of keeping time. This is what caused it to be used by a lot of people all over the place.It works on principle of periodic motion.

Also, Marine Two is the call sign of any Marine aircraft carrying the Vice President of the United States. If both the President and Vice President are on the same Marine aircraft, the aircraft gets the Marine One call sign.

Bibimbap

Bibimbap is one of the most famous Korean traditional foods. The word "bibimbap" means stirred or mixed rice. It is served as a bowl of rice with more ingredients on it. These ingredients can include some vegetables (spinach, herbs, potherb, and gosari). Beef or seafood can be added too.

There are some theories or stories about the origin of Bibimbap. It was the first written about in a cook book in the late 1800s. The first theory is the "palace food theory". It says that bibimbap was served as a light meal whenever the king wanted something to eat.

The second theory is the "meal for peasants during the farming season". As it was too difficult for peasants to have regular meals during the farming season, they would use a single bowl, where rice was combined with vegetables.

The third theory is the "Donghak uprising theory". When Donghak uprising broke out in the Jeolla provinces in 1894, the Donghak peasants were forced to mix their rice with side dishes because they didn't have enough plates or bowls.

Because Bibimbap has many ingredients, it contains a lot of nutrition. Also, its color and appearance, can be very different. It is easy to prepare and clean up because it is all packed in one bowl.


Class struggle

Class struggle, or class warfare or class conflict, is tension or antagonism in society. It is said to exist because different groups of people have different interests.

Looking at society this way is a feature of Marxism and socialism. Social sciences group people with similar social features into classes. Most of these features are economic.

According to Marxism, there are two main classes of people: The bourgeoisie controls the capital and means of production, and the proletariat provide the labour. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels say that for most of history, there has been a struggle between those two classes. This struggle is known as class struggle. After "The Communist Manifesto" and "Das Kapital", this concept became well known.

Class struggle happens when the bourgeoisie (the rich) pay the proletariat (the workers) to make things for them to sell. The workers have no say in their pay or what things they make, since they cannot live without a job or money.

Karl Marx saw that the workers had to work without any say in the business. He believed that since the workers make the things, they should say where they go and for how much, instead of the rich owners. They had to work hard to earn a living, while making the rich richer just doing simple office work.

Since they had to earn money to buy food, and jobs were the only things that give money, they had no choice but to work for the rich who made the business. The rich became richer while the worker hauled and lifted and did all of that hard manual stuff no one really likes to do.

Karl Marx thought that their labor limited their freedom. He wanted the workers to unite and take over the business, so that they could all be prosperous. He thought that the common man deserved to run the business, and that the rich were not better than the commoner.

Class struggle appeared in some forms. First, there is an economic form. The proletariat struggle with the bourgeoisie through their laborer's organization in this form. Second, there is a political form. In this form, the proletariat has their party and, through democracy, they try to change the system. And the last, there is an ideological struggle. In this form, the proletariat try to adapt the old governing system to new social situations. There are other forms of struggle, too. These forms are not exclusive, but exist at the same time.

Class struggle appeared all throughout history. At first, people lived in small communist societies. Then, they took property from the Earth for themselves and started to use slaves. They then had feudalism, which meant one person owned an entire area of land and used soldiers and workers to help them make money, and only gave their workers land, but they had some freedom that slaves didn't. Finally, in Karl Marx's time, people in some countries were becoming workers and bosses during the industrial revolution. The bosses owned the machines that the workers used to make things, but they didn't help using the machines. Instead, they made money by buying the time and energy of the workers to make things. Marx believed that the workers were not making as much money as they deserved because the boss would make money from the work they did without helping.

Marx believed that countries would overthrow capitalism and that workplaces would move toward socialism. This roughly means that the workers would control the workplaces. When this would have happened everywhere, Marx thought the world will have achieved communism.

The Soviet Union overthrew feudalism. They never reached the point of capitalism, so their society was very corrupt. Many blame them for the bad name of communism. There are some workplaces and societies are run democratically by workers, such as the kibbutzim in Israel.

Social democrats and liberal conservatives do not see society as described by Marx. They see society as changing gradually, through the system of democratic voting. The European Union is composed almost entirely of countries governed by this kind of system, but it is not universal throughout the world. Very few countries have undergone the kind of revolution forecast by Marx. It is much more common for military leaders to seize power and enforce a dictatorship which is neither democratic nor revolutionary.



Grand Korean Waterway

The Grand Korean Waterway plan, officially known as the Pan Korea Grand Waterway, consists of 3 canals. They are called the Seoul-Busan Canal, the Honam Canal , and the North Korea Canal .

The Seoul-Busan Canal runs between Seoul and Busan, two of South Korea's largest cities, and connecting the Han River and Nakdong River. Then the Honam Canal, which runs through ChungCheongBuk-do, ChungCheongNam-do, JeollaBuk-do, and JeollaNam-do, connects Geum River and YeongSan River. The North Korea Canal would connect SinUiJu-Pyongyang-GaeSeong, Wonsan-GaeSeong. 

The canal was a project headed by Lee Myung Bak, who was South Korea's president from 2008 to 2013. It is hugely controversial. Many Koreans object to this plan. Former president Lee said that he would not carry out this plan if many people objected to this idea, but there was a person who works in the Korea Institute of Construction Technology has confessed that government's 'Four-Major-River Arrangement Plan' is a canal project in reality.

The major canal in this plan is the GyeongBu Canal (Seoul-Busan Canal). The GyeongBu Canal starts in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. It flows along the Han River, and encounter with mountains. And then a 40 km-long tunnel begins, connecting the Han River with the Nakdong River.

Many Koreans are anxious about this plan. Critics of the plan say that this canal is not efficient at all. They say that mountains along the proposed route would make it difficult and expensive to construct. Currently, the major transportation method on the GyeongBu (Seoul-Busan) line is road transport, which takes 5 hours. 

However, ships following the GyeongBu Canal will take 25 hours to finish the trip. Critics believe this plan would just be a waste of money. In addition, it could be harmful to the environment and damage cultural treasures. On the other hand, supporters of this plan say that this canal will lessen congestion on the GyeongBu Expressway and GyeongBu Railroad line. Furthermore, sand from dredging the river bed could be sold for use in construction. They argue that this money could be used to fund the construction of the canals. However, critics argue that sand prices will be so cheap that little money will be earned from selling the sand. They say that it is only beneficial to the construction industry.



Parallelism (grammar)

Parallelism is a way of writing that uses a sentence (or part of a sentence) that is very much like the one before it. The language parts often have the same grammatical structure and are said to be "in balance". The word "parallel" comes from a Greek word that means "next to one another."

In a parallelism, a first statement often will be repeated "in other words" by the second statement. These other words often add to the meaning of the first statement. For example, "The winter winds blow hard. The cold air pushes us back." In the second sentence, "cold air" is parallel to "winter winds", and "pushes us back" is parallel to "blow hard" (it is what the winter winds do). 

Parallelism is a common pattern in the writing of the ancient Near East and Biblical poetry. It can also be found in the work of European and American writers like William Shakespeare:"I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,"

"My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,"

"My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,"

"My figured goblets for a dish of wood,"

"My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,"

"My subjects for a pair of carved saints"

"And my large kingdom for a little grave" 

(Richard II, Act 3, Scene 3, Lines 147-153)"" and Walt Whitman"There was never any more inception than there is now,"

"Nor any more youth or age than there is now,"

"And will never be any more perfection than there is now,"

"Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now."

("Song of Myself" Section 3, Stanza 2).

Tropical Storm Arthur (2008)

Tropical Storm Arthur was the first tropical storm to form in May since 1981. Arthur was a weak tropical storm that affected Central America. Arthur was the first tropical storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. Arthur formed from the remains of dissipating Tropical Storm Alma which crossed Central America from the Pacific Ocean. Arthur caused nine deaths in Belize and caused $78 million in damage. 

Tropical Storm Fay (2008)

Tropical Storm Fay was the sixth tropical storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. Tropical Storm Fay caused flooding in Haiti, the next three storms would do that same thing (Gustav, Hanna, and Ike). Tropical Storm Fay made landfall in Florida four times, beating a record from Hurricane Gordon in 1994, which made landfall in Florida three times. Fay left $560 million in damage and killed 36 people.

Fay started as a tropical wave off of Africa on August 7. It did not become a tropical depression until August 15. Shortly later it became Tropical Storm Fay. Fay then crossed Dominican Republic and Haiti. 
Fay continued west and made two landfalls in Cuba. One in Cabo Cruz on August 17 and Cienfuegos on August 18, at both landfalls Fay had winds of 50 mph. 
Fay made its first landfall in Florida at Key West also on August 18 winds were at 60 mph. 
The next day Fay made landfall in Cape Romano, Florida while winds were at 65 mph. Fay moved over Florida and strangely strengthened while over Florida. Fay moved off of Florida near Melbourne. Fay moved north just off of Florida and made another landfall in Flagler Beach, Florida on August 21 while winds were at 65 mph. 
Fay moved into the Gulf of Mexico and then made her fourth and final landfall in Florida on August 23. Fay became extratropical on August 27 and also died on August 27. 
Even though Fay caused a lot of damage it was not retired, Fay is on the list of names in 2014.


Hurricane Gustav

Hurricane Gustav was one of 16 named storms, one of seven hurricanes, and one of five major hurricanes in the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. Hurricane Gustav form on August 25, made landfall in three countries, Haiti, Cuba, and the United States, the storm died on September 4. Gustav caused about $6.61 Billion in damage, also 112 direct and 41 indirect deaths.

In the spring of 2009 the name Gustav was retired, it was replaced by Gonzalo in 2014.



Hurricane Kyle (2008)

Hurricane Kyle was the eleventh tropical storm and sixth hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. As a low pressure area, it moved slowly across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola. The low dumped heavy rains across those islands.

It later dumped heavy rain Puerto Rico. That resulted in six deaths and $48 million in damage.

A hurricane watch was put up for Maine on September 27. This was the first hurricane watch in 17 years in the state. Elsewhere in New England, the last hurricane watch was 12 years earlier when Hurricane Edouard brushed eastern Massachusetts.

The storm produced high waves along the coasts of Rhode Island and Connecticut. A newly married couple was killed when high waves knocked the wife into rocky shores. Her husband jumped in to save her. He was overcome by the waves himself.

It later struck west-central Nova Scotia as a mild hurricane. When it struck, its winds were near 75 mph. Damage was minor, at $9 million USD.

Tropical Storm Marco (2008)

Tropical Storm Marco was the smallest tropical cyclone ever. It was the 13th named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. Marco started from a large storm over the northwestern Caribbean Sea during late September 2008. It later became a tropical depression. Marco reached its peak strength with winds of 65 miles per hour (100 km/h) on October 7. Marco hit land near Misantla, Veracruz. Because it was a very small storm, Marco caused little damage.

Baobab

Baobab is the common name of a genus of trees (Adansonia). There are a total of eight types of its kind: six species live in the drier parts of Madagascar, two in mainland Africa, one in Australia and three in India. It is the national tree of Madagascar.

Other common names include 'boab', 'boaboa', 'bottle tree', 'the tree of life', 'upside-down tree', and 'monkey bread tree'. The trees reach heights of 5 to 30 meters (16 to 98 ft) and trunk diameters of 7 to 11 meters (23 to 36 ft.). Its trunk can hold up to 120,000 liters of water. For most of the year, the tree is leafless, and looks very much like it has its roots sticking up in the air.

Baobabs are one of the largest and most important trees in all of where they grow, as they are able to provide shelter and wood. The leaves of the tree are used for making soup and the tree has some medicinal purposes in some regions of Africa for treating ailments such as wounds, diarrhea, asthma, fever, and malaria.

The trees are long-lived, but just how long is disputed. The owners of Sunland Farm in Limpopo, South Africa have built a pub called "The Big Baobab Pub" inside the hollow trunk of the high tree. The tree is 47 m (155 ft) in circumference, and is said to have been carbon dated at over 6,000 years old.

The baobab tree is known as the tree of life, with good reason. It can provide shelter, clothing, food, and water for the animal and human inhabitants of the African savannah regions. The cork-like bark and huge stem are fire resistant and are used for making cloth and rope. The leaves are used as condiments and medicines. The fruit, called "monkey bread", is edible, and full of vitamin C. As of 2010 experts estimate the potential international market at a billion united states dollars a year.

The fruit has a velvety shell and is about the size of a coconut, weighing about . It has a somewhat acidic flavour, described as 'somewhere between grapefruit, pear, and vanilla'.

The tree can store hundreds of liters of water, which is an adaptation to the harsh drought conditions of its environment. The tree may be tapped in dry periods.

Mature trees are usually hollow, providing living space for many animals and humans. Trees are even used as bars, barns, wine and beer shops and more.

Hurricane Kenneth (2005)

Hurricane Kenneth was the strongest hurricane in the 2005 Pacific hurricane season. After the hurricane died out, what was left of Kenneth came near another weather system, and it caused rain on the Hawaiian Islands. Because of the heavy rain, there was flooding. At Nu‘uanu Pali on Oahu, the rain reached 10.25 inches (260.4 mm). The rain was so heavy that 4.11 inches (104 mm) fell in one hour. The rain reached 12 inches (305 mm) in other areas. This made Kenneth tied for the 9th rainiest tropical storm in Hawaii. One example of the flooding was 1 foot (300 mm) of water on Hawaii Route 61. This flooded a few houses. There was flooding on some rivers. 

Kenneth caused stormy seas along the coast. Waves were between 8 and 10 feet (2 and 3 metres) high. These high waves crashed along the east shores of these islands:
There was no bad damage, and no people were killed by Kenneth.

Réaumur scale

The Réaumur scale is a way of measuring temperature. The unit associated with the scale is called "Réaumur", named after the physicist René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur who created it in 1731. The unit is usually abbreviated "Ré", sometimes "r". The two base points of the scale are the melting point of ice and the boiling point of water, both at normal pressure. There are 80 degrees between those values, one degree Réaumur is the 80th part of that temperature difference. 

Réaumur used ethanol for his thermometers. Thermometers that use ethanol show the change of temperature better than those using mercury. This is because, when heated, ethanol expands faster than mercury. There is the problem though that the expansion of ethanol is different at different temperatures - it is non-linear. Ethanol has a very low boiling point, which makes thermometers based on it unusable for many applications. Soon, instrument-makers used other liquids, and then chose "80°Ré" as the boiling point of water. 

In 1772 Jean-André Deluc studied the several substances used in thermometers at the time. At the time, new theories of heat were being developed. 
Deluc's analysis came to the conclusion that mercury-based thermometers were the best for practical use: He made an experiment, as follows: Suppose there are two amounts of water, say one liter, are mixed. The two amounts have different temperatures. The temperature of both liquids are taken, before the mix, and the temperature of the mix is measured. The mix should have the temperature that is the mean of both temperatures. This relationship only held reliably, when mercury was used in thermometers. From the late 18th century, almost all thermometers used mercury, for this reason. Thermometers that use other substances than ethanol but have 80 scales between the boiling and the freezing points of water have nothing in common with Réaumur's thermometer, except for the name.

Gödel's incompleteness theorems

Gödel's incompleteness theorems is the name given to two theorems (true mathematical statements), proved by Kurt Gödel in 1931. They are theorems in mathematical logic.

Mathematicians once thought that everything that is true has a mathematical proof. A system that has this property is called "complete"; one that does not is called "incomplete". Also, mathematical ideas should not have "contradictions". This means that they should not be true and false at the same time. A system that does not include contradictions is called "consistent". A system is a collection of theorems (logical consequences) based on axioms (basic assumptions). Axioms are statements that are accepted as true, and need no proof.

Gödel said that "every non-trivial formal system (consistent and axiomatic system with theorems listable by following an algorithm) is incomplete and not provably consistent":

Outline of Proof of Gödel’s Theorems

The proof of Gödel’s theorems is based on forming and considering special self-referential statements.

One way to prove the theorems is to consider the first theorem before considering the second theorem. There are three parts in this proof:

A. Consider the first theorem and the truth of this first statement “This statement cannot be proved”: proving this first statement would be a contradiction because there would then be a proof for a statement that cannot be proved. For the sake of the consistency of the system, the first statement and hence the first theorem are therefore true but unprovable. 

B. Recall from part A that if we were able to prove the first statement then our system would be inconsistent. Thus to prove the consistency of the system, we must prove that the first statement is not provable (ie: prove the contrapositive of the claim “if we were able to prove the first statement then our system would be inconsistent”). Because of self-reference in the first statement “this statement cannot be proved” (ie: proving the first statement is not provable is proving the first statement), therefore proof of the consistency of the system requires proof of the first statement. 

C. Recall in part A that consistency of the system is why the first statement is true and unprovable. Hence by the truth of the first statement and the conclusion in part B, it follows that the consistency of the system cannot be proved with the axioms of the system. Hence the second theorem is established. The truth of the first theorem is established in part A. 

Importance of Gödel‘s Theorems 

The first theorem is important to mathematicians because it proves that it is impossible to create a set of axioms that explains everything in maths. The second theorem is important because it proves that the soundness of a system, soundness means only logically valid theorems are provable, cannot be proved; this means that you know that you cannot be assured that all proofs conclude in truths.


Cilia

A cilium (plural "cilia") is an organelle found in eukaryotic cells. Cilia are slender protuberances that project from the much larger cell body.

There are two types of cilia: 

In eukaryotes, cilia and flagella together make up a group of organelles known as undulipodia.
Eukaryotic cilia are structurally identical to eukaryotic flagella, although distinctions are sometimes made according to function and/or length.

Motile cilia are found on protist ciliates like "Paramecium". They are how "Paramecium" moves around. They are also found on the epithelial cells of many internal organs of metazoans, such as the digestive system and the trachea of the lungs.

Non-motile (or "primary") cilia usually occur one per cell; nearly all mammalian cells have a single non-motile "primary cilium". In addition, examples of specialized primary cilia can be found in human sensory organs such as the eye and the nose: 

Cilia are structurally almost identical with the much larger flagella. So much so that it has been proposed protists bearing either should be unified in the Phylum "Undulipodia". Previously, Margulis had proposed that the Ciliates alone should be placed in a Phylum "Ciliophora". Admittedly, the Protista is a collection of disparate single-celled forms, but while a more sophisticated taxonomy is in flux (changing), Protista is still a useful term.

Cilia and flagella are cell organelles, specialised units which carry out well-defined functions, like mitochondria and plastids. It is fairly certain now that all or most of these organelles have their origin in once-independent prokaryotes (bacteria or archaea), and that the eukaryote cell is a 'community of micro-organisms' working together in 'a marriage of convenience'.

Thirty Seconds to Mars

Thirty Seconds to Mars is an American alternative rock band from Los Angeles. This band was started in 1998 by the actor Jared Leto and his brother Shannon Leto. The current members of the band are Jared Leto (lead vocals) and Shannon Leto (drummer).

According to an interview from Virgin Records, the band's name;"Actually comes
from a thesis that the band found online that was written by a former Harvard professor. And one of the subsections of the
thesis was titled "Thirty Seconds to Mars" and he goes on to talk about the exponential growth of technology that relates to humans and saying that we are quite literally thirty seconds to mars. What it means to us is, we thought it best described our music, in short."

Even if Jared Leto is a major Hollywood actor, he prefers not to use this information to "sell" the band and he refuses to play shows where they use his name to promote the band.

He dedicated the final song of the show, "R-Evolve", to Matt. They are also played in various festivals as Roskilde, Rock am Ring, Pinkpop, Give It A Name and Download.

In August 2008, Virgin Records filed a $30 million lawsuit, claiming the band refused to deliver three albums as required by its contract. According to the lawsuit, the band "repudiated" a 1999 contract in July.

On February 11, 2009 issue of Kerrang!, the working title for the new album is said to be "This Is War". On Twitter, Jared released a bit of information about his trip to Haiti, and recorded a song called "Hurricane" with Kanye West and Brandon Flowers of The Killers.

On April 28, they returned from EMI and the lawsuit was annulled.

Soon after the announcement of the lawsuit settlement, Thirty Seconds to Mars told MTV News have promised to release "This Is War" by October 2009.

SQL slammer worm

The SQL slammer worm (also known as W32.SQLExp.Worm) was a highly damaging computer worm that spread on the internet in early 2003.

The SQL worm mainly attacked computers that had Microsoft SQL Server 2000 or Microsoft Desktop Engine 2000 on them. The worm also produces a Denial-of-Service attack on some websites and computers because it sends too much data.

In June 2002, Microsoft released a patch that fixed the weakness that the SQL worm attacked. However, many people did not fix the weakness. In January 2003, the worm was released. Within ten minutes of its release, it had attacked and infected 75,000 internet servers. Bank of America was one of the largest companies affected by the worm. Many of its ATM's would not work for consumers. The damage got worse, and on January 25, 2003, the worm cause a global internet slowdown. The worm was reported to have interfered with 911 calls and was responsible for many canceled flights.

During its lifetime in 2003, the SQL worm caused about 1 billion U.S Dollars in damage.


Computer worm

A computer worm is a kind of malware that is able to copy itself, and spread. Unlike a computer virus, this is done without changing files on a computer, and without affecting the boot sector of media. Worms do not need human help to reproduce. Worms spread over networks, or on removable media like USB flash drives. They almost always need a helper program that is able to access the network, or that executes when a new medium is inserted. 
In that way, a Worm could start a program to send electronic mail, and send itself on to all the addresses in the address book of the email application. A very famous worm that appeared in 2000 was called ILOVEYOU (or "Love Letter"), it sent a simple mail with the subject ILOVEYOU, and an attachment of a document that contained the worm code. 

Worms usually do not cause direct damage to a system. But they consume memory and network bandwidth, slowing down the computer. This makes it almost impossible to work with. Other examples of Worms are CodeRed and Sircam.

Royal Rumble (2009)

Royal Rumble (2009) was a wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) made by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It took place in Detroit, Michigan at the Joe Louis Arena. The event was held on January 22, 2009.

The event had the 22nd annual Royal Rumble match as the main event, which Randy Orton won. One of the matches was Jeff Hardy defending his WWE Championship against Edge. Another was John Cena defending his World Heavyweight Championship against John "Bradshaw" Layfield with his employee Shawn Michaels. A third match was Jack Swagger defending his ECW Championship against Matt Hardy. The last match was Beth Phoenix defending her WWE Women's Championship against Melina.

450,000 paid to see the event. This was down from 533,000 the year before.

The main match in the Rumble was the yearly Royal Rumble match. The match starts with two wrestlers with another wrestler coming to the ring every 90 seconds until all 30 have entered. The match ends when one wrestler remains in the ring. This is after all 29 other wrestlers have been eliminated by being thrown over the top ring rope and having both feet touch the floor. The winner was given a championship match for the WWE, World Heavyweight, or ECW Championship at WrestleMania XXV.

The main rivalry from the Raw brand was John "Bradshaw" Layfield (JBL) challenging John Cena for the World Heavyweight Championship. JBL earned his championship match against Cena after winning a Fatal Four-Way elimination match on the December 29, 2008 episode of "Raw" by beating Chris Jericho, Randy Orton, and Shawn Michaels.

Another rivalry from the Raw brand was Melina challenging Beth Phoenix for her WWE Women's Championship in a singles match Melina won the chance to face Phoenix on the December 29, 2008 episode of "Raw" by winning a battle royal.

The main rivalry from the SmackDown brand going into the Royal Rumble was Jeff Hardy and Edge fighting over the WWE Championship. At WWE's last pay-per-view event, Armageddon, Hardy defeated Edge and Triple H in a Triple Threat match, a match with three wrestlers, to win the WWE Championship. On the January 2, 2009 episode of "SmackDown", Vickie Guerrero said that Edge would face Hardy for the WWE title at the Royal Rumble.

ECW's main rivalry was Jack Swagger and Matt Hardy fighting over the ECW Championship. On the January 13, 2009 episode of "ECW", Swagger beat Hardy to win the ECW Championship. On the January 16 episode of "SmackDown", it was announced that Swagger would defend the ECW title against Hardy in a match at the Royal Rumble.

The first match of the night had Jack Swagger fight Matt Hardy for the ECW Championship. Swagger was the defending champion. The match began having both wrestlers countering (reversing) each other's moves. This continued until Swagger hurt Hardy's shoulder. Swagger targeted this part of the body on Matt for the rest of the match. Swagger won the match by pin after hitting his finisher (the signature move that he used to finish a match) on him, a gutwrench powerbomb. As a result, Swagger remained the ECW Champion.

The next match was for the WWE Women's Championship. The champion, Beth Phoenix was set to defend her title against Melina. The match saw Phoenix in control for a lot of the match with Beth focusing on Melina's legs. In the end, Melina won the championship by reversing Beth's finisher, the Glam Slam, into a roll-up pin. This resulted in Melina becoming the new WWE Women's Champion.

In the third match, John Cena faced JBL to defend his World Heavyweight Championship. JBL's employee, Shawn Michaels, came to the ring with JBL. When the referee was knocked out, Shawn entered the ring and hit his finisher, Sweet Chin Music, on both JBL and Cena leaving them in the ring on the mat (floor of the ring) but with JBL's arm on top of Cena, which is a type of pin. But before the referee woke up Cena got up and hit his finisher, the Attitude Adjustment, to pin JBL and keep his championship.

The fourth match of the night had Jeff Hardy fight against Edge for the WWE Championship. Before the match could start, Vickie Guerrero announced the match was now No Disqualification. Edge then said that he would have Chavo Guerrero outside the ring. Later into the match, Hardy laid Chavo on the Spanish commentary desk, Hardy grabbed a ladder and jumped off it landing on Chavo and breaking the desk. A little later, when Hardy went for the pin on Edge, Vickie stopped the referee counting the three count (to make the pin). Hardy's brother Matt then ran down to the ring to help his brother. At first it appeared Matt was setting up Edge for a con-chair-to, but he instead attacked his brother turning heel. Edge came to and pinned Jeff to win the WWE Championship.

The last match of the night, or the main event, was the Royal Rumble match. Rey Mysterio and John Morrison started the Rumble. The final six people left in the match were The Big Show, The Undertaker, Triple H and The Legacy (Cody Rhodes, Ted DiBiase, and Randy Orton). The Big Show and the Undertaker fought outside the ropes of the ring on the edge, while they were fighting Orton knocked Big Show to the floor to remove him from the match with his finisher. Big Show out of anger pulled the Undertaker down eliminating him. This left Legacy and Triple H. Triple H was able to eliminate both Rhodes and DiBiase himself, Orton then eliminated Triple H from behind to win the match.

Carlos Alberto Torres

Carlos Alberto "Capita" Torres (17 July 1944 – 25 October 2016), also known as the "Captain of the Third", was a former Brazilian football player. He has played for Brazil national team. A technically talented defender with good ball skills and defensive ability, he is widely regarded as one of the best defenders of all time. He also stood out for his leadership and was an excellent penalty taker. In the 1970 FIFA World Cup Final, Carlos Alberto scored the fourth Brazilian goal that closed the 4-1 rout against Italy. His goal is considered one of the greatest goals in the history of the tournament. Considered one of the greatest players in history in his position, he was the captain of the Brazilian team that won the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, becoming known as the Capitão do Tri. As far as clubs go, Carlos Alberto has played for Fluminense, Botafogo, Flamengo, California Surf, Santos and New York Cosmos. He was Pelé 's teammate in the last two clubs.

Carlos Alberto joined Fluminense at the age of 19. He quickly made a name for himself in the team, and this from his first season at the club, thanks to his defensive qualities and his vision of the game but also an ability to dribble but also to make his teammates play, rare qualities for defenders. at that time. In 1966, he left for the Santos club where he joined his teammate Pelé. In 1974, he returned to Fluminense and enabled the club to win two consecutive Rio championships. Three years later, in 1977, he moved to Flamengo, Fluminense's biggest rival.

Despite his success in Brazil, Carlos Torres joined New York club Cosmos in 1977. He arrived on the day of the New York power outage and reunited with his former teammate and friend Pelé. He helped his club win back-to-back NASL titles in 1979 and 1980. After a year at the California Surf club, he returned to New York and won a third NASL 3 title with his club in 1982. During his five years in the NASL, he was elected to the All-Stars team of the year five times and scored eight goals in 119 regular season games and 26 playoff games. He bid farewell on September 28, 1982 during a match between Cosmos and his former club Flamengo.

Between 1964 and 1977, Carlos Alberto Torres was capped 53 times and scored eight goals with Brazil. In 1966, he was on the list of forty-four players likely to participate in the 1966 FIFA World Cup but he was not retained in the final list of twenty-two players. At this edition of the World Cup, in England, Brazil is eliminated in the group stages. When João Saldanha is responsible for restoring the image of the Selecao, he recognizes Carlos Alberto's ability to lead a team and decides to make him the new captain of Brazil. His extroverted character is also suitable for taking on this role of leader of the group. He is therefore the captain of the Brazilian team that won the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico. Despite his position at fullback, Carlos Alberto scored the last goal in the final against Italy - on a blind pass from Pelé. This goal is considered one of the best scored in the competition. 1970 was the best year of his career with Brazil. He couldn't participate in the 1974 World Cup because of a persistent knee injury. When he regains a certain physical form, his speed has decreased markedly. Nevertheless, his vision of the game which makes it possible to compensate for his low speed, allows him to occupy the position of central defender. After some return to form, he was selected again with Brazil. In 1977, his coach Cláudio Coutinho called him up to captain the Selecao in the first three qualifying matches for the 1978 World Cup. He performs well despite seven years of absence in the national team. He is approaching 33 when he retires from international duty and immediately joins the New York Cosmos. Even today, he is considered one of the best players to have worn the colors of Brazil.

Torres died in Rio de Janeiro on October 25, 2016 due to a sudden heart attack, aged 72.

While he was a member of this group, he discovered the existence of a new war machine, called Metal Gear. It is a staple throughout the series, as the title suggests. He fights a new type of Metal Gear in every games. In the fourth release in the Metal Gear Solid series, Snake's codename is changed to "Old Snake" as a reference to his old age. In reality, he is not actually as old as he seems. A side effect of the cloning that created him, was an aging process that would speed up when he reached a certain age, around the time a normal human's body starts to weaken. It should be noted, that another side effect of the cloning, is that he cannot have children.

Snake appeared in the Nintendo fighting games "Super Smash Bros. Brawl" and "Super Smash Bros. Ultimate".

Food web

A food web is similar to a food chain but larger. The diagram combines many food chains into energy relationships among organisms. Food webs show how plants and animals are connected in many ways. The arrow points from the organism being eaten to the organism that eats it. 

A food web (or food cycle) is a natural interconnection of food chains. The two extreme categories (trophic levels) are: 
A gradient exists: there are different kinds of feeding relations: herbivory, carnivory, scavenging and parasitism. 

Some of the organic matter eaten by heterotrophs, such as sugars, provides energy. Autotrophs and heterotrophs come in all sizes, from microscopic to many tonnes from cyanobacteria to giant redwoods, and from viruses to blue whales.

Stalinism

Stalinism refers to the political system under Joseph Stalin, including ideology and state administration. A secret history of those days is contained in the Mitrokhin Archives. Stalinism involves using strong state leadership and suppression of opposition to quickly develop a country. Lazar Kaganovich, a Soviet politician, coined the term.

Stalinism existed in the Soviet Union from 1924 to 1956. The Soviet Union was an agricultural country in 1924, but by 1956 it was a powerful industrial country with good living standards. This happened because of the 5-year plans of the government. These plans contained all economic development to happen in the 5 years.

The controversial part of Stalinism is that to do all these things, the government detained or killed many people who didn't like the government. A few hundred thousand people were detained or killed.

Ozone layer

The ozone layer is a layer of ozone high up in the Earth's atmosphere stratosphere, between approximately 10 kilometres and 50 kilometres above Earth’s surface. The exact amount of ozone varies, depending on the seasons and the location.

Over the last hundred years, the ozone layer has been damaged by man-made chemicals, especially CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), which were used mainly in aerosol sprays and refrigerants. CFCs are broken down in the upper atmosphere when they react with the ozone, causing ozone depletion. International leaders recognized this and united in banning the use of CFCs. As a result, the hole in the ozone layer has been shrinking and the ozone layer has been recovering. 

The ozone layer was discovered in 1913 by French physicists Charles Fabry and Henri Buisson. Its properties were explored in detail by the British meteorologist G. M. B. Dobson, who developed a simple spectrophotometer, the Dobsonmeter. This tool could be used to measure the ozone levels found in the stratosphere from the ground. Between 1928 and 1958 Dobson established a worldwide network of ozone monitoring stations. Most of these stations are still in use today. The "Dobson unit", a convenient measure of the total amount of ozone in a column overhead, is named in his honor.

Dolly (sheep)

Dolly (5 July 1996 – 14 February 2003) was a sheep, remarkable in being the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic cell. 

A somatic cell is a regular body cell, not an egg cell. The nucleus of the somatic cell was removed and put into an unfertilised egg cell. The process is called somatic cell nuclear transfer. She was cloned at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, Scotland. It took 277 attempts to create Dolly. The success rate when cloning animals is very low. 

The cell used as the donor for the cloning of Nam was taken from a mammary gland. The production of a healthy clone therefore proved that a cell taken from a specific part of the body could recreate a whole individual. She was cloned so she did not need any male cells to fertilize the egg and mature it. She only has one parent.

Dolly lived the rest of her life at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh untill she died. There she was bred with a Welsh Mountain ram and had six lambs in total called; Bonnie, Rosie, Lucy, Sally, Darcy and Cotton. 

On 14 February 2003, Dolly was killed because she had a lung disease and severe arthritis.

Fozzie Bear

Fozzie Bear is a character from "The Muppet Show". He is a brownish-orange colored bear. He wears a hat, and a pink and white tie. Fozzie is a comedian, so his job is to tell jokes. He is famous for not telling very good jokes. He is often heckled and insulted by two old men, Statler and Waldorf. A phrase that Fozzie is known to say is "wakka wakka wakka." The phrase has no meaning, but is usually used after a joke to make the joke seem funnier. Fozzie is a fairly good friend to Kermit the Frog, although he does annoy Kermit at times. He seems to annoy Miss Piggy much more often.

Fozzie Bear was first played by Frank Oz. He is now played by Eric Jacobson.

Dan Morgan (bushranger)

Dan Morgan (1830 - 9 April 1865) was an Australian bushranger. His real name was John Fuller, but he may have had his mother's surname and been known as Daniel Owen. He was also called John Smith, "Down-the-river Jack" and "Billy the Native". His most famous name was “Mad Dan Morgan.” He robbed people in the Riverina area, but was seen as a friend of the poor workers.

Dan Morgan was born in Campbelltown, New South Wales in 1830. His mother was Mary Owen, known as "The Gipsy". As a small child he was adopted by “Jack the Welshman”, a travelling hawker from Appin. He went to school in Appin. As a young teenager, he hit a policeman and was put in Berrima Gaol for six months. He went to Victoria to look for gold in the 1850s. In 1854 he was arrested for armed robbery at Castlemaine, Victoria. Judge Redmond Barry (the same judge who sentenced Ned Kelly) sent him to Pentridge Gaol for twelve years, the first two years spent in chains. He was also kept on the prison ship "Success". He was released after six years and went back to Appin. He worked as a stockman at Wagga Wagga.

In 1860 he stole horses from two squatters (farmers) at Whitfield, Victoria in the King River valley. The squatters, Evans and Bond, followed Morgan's tracks to where he was camped. They shot Morgan with their guns, but he was able to escape.

In July 1865, Morgan and his friend, “German Bill”, began to rob from farms around Gundagai, New South Wales. They stole food, gunpowder, guns, watches, and horses. There is story that he killed German Bill, but there is no proof. Morgan robbed the police magistrate from Wagga Wagga, Henry Bayliss. Morgan said he would not shoot him as long as he didn’t report the robbery to the police. Bayliss told the police at Urana, and a search party was sent from Wagga Wagga. With the help of black trackers (Indigenous Australians with tracking skills), the police found Morgan’s camp. In the shooting that followed, Morgan shot Bayliss in the hand and shoulder. Morgan escaped into the bush. After more robberies, the government put a reward of £500 for the capture of Morgan.

In June 1864, Morgan went to Round Hill station (farm), near the town of Culcairn, New South Wales, where he locked all the workers up. He made the squatter (owner), Watson, give them all extra alcohol. When they asked him about bushranging, he became angry. He wanted to kill Watson, but after Watson's wife stood in front of her husband, Morgan shot him in the hand. He then told farm worker John McLean to go and get help, but quickly changed his mind and shot McLean in the back. McLean was badly wounded. Morgan was upset by this, and stayed with him even though the police were searching for him. McLean died from his injuries three days after being shot. One week later, June 24 1864, he met up with two policemen near Tumbarumba. Morgan shot police Sergeant McGinnerty dead. The other man, Constable Churchley, escaped. After the killings, the government increased the reward to £1000. In September, another policeman, Sergeant Smyth, was shot and killed. Morgan said that he fired the shot. In March 1865, the government made him an outlaw, which meant he could be shot and killed by anyone without warning.

Morgan often became angry, sometimes without warning. Farmers in the area were scared he would set their crops and haystacks on fire. He would be very nasty to any farmer that did not treat their workers properly. In 1865 he held up a farm at Mohanga. He made the farmer, Bobby Rand, give all the workers a drink, then made him dance for them until he collapsed.

A Victorian newspaper said that if he came to Victoria, the police there would soon catch him. He went to the King River area of Victoria and began to rob farms. He wanted to get back at Evans who had shot him several years earlier. On April 8 1865, he held up the Peechelba station (farm). He made them cook and serve him dinner. One of the maids was able to escape and tell the neighbors what was happening. By 3.00 am, the police had arrived from Wangaratta and together with workers from nearby farms, they surrounded Peechelba. When he came out of the farm house next morning he was shot in the back by a stockman, Jack Quinlan. He died at 2.00pm.

Police Superintendent Cobham took Morgan's body back to Wangaratta and put it on display. Dr. Henry, of Benalla, cut off Morgan’s beard, tearing off skin as he cut it. Henry cut off Morgan’s head and sent it to Professor George Halford at Melbourne University for examination. People were horrified by the idea of Morgan's body being cut into pieces; the government was forced to have an inquiry. Cobham got into a lot of trouble and was given a less important job.

Stop Stansted Expansion

Stop Stansted Expansion is a pressure group established in 2002. It was originally a working group of the North West Essex and East Herts Preservation Association, in response to the Government's consultation on expanding UK airports and, particularly, expansion plans for Stansted Airport defined in 2001. It has around 7,500 members and registered online supporters and its campaign director is "Carol Barbone".
The group's objective is to "restrict the development of Stansted Airport within tight limits that are truly sustainable and, in this way, to protect the quality of life of its supporters over wide areas of Essex, Hertfordshire and Suffolk, to preserve local heritage and to protect the natural environment."

The organisation delayed the time-frame for second runway plans for Stansted by four years (from 2011 to 2015).

If the plans went ahead, there would be climate change effects. The predicted annual equivalent carbon dioxide emissions ( they are around 5 million tonnes a year at present) are 12 million tonnes annually with full use of the existing runway and up to 23 million tonnes a year with a second runway.
On the 9th October 2008, the UK Government approved an increase in Stansted's permitted passenger throughput from 25 million passengers per annum to 35 million using the existing runway following a Public Enquiry. Stop Stansted Expansion described this decision as "entirely predictable, cynical and unjustified". After this announcement, on 14 November, Stop Stansted Expansion lodged an Appeal with the High Court.

A key part of the campaign against the second runway is to stimulate letters of objection to the application. Uttlesford District Council has received over nine thousand representations to date.

Passenger traffic at Stansted is falling sharply. The airport handled 6% fewer passenger in 2008 than in the previous year (22.3m passengers compared to 23.8m passengers in 2007). The campaign says that "increasing passenger numbers from 25mppa to 35mppa will not make any difference in the short term. Indeed, with the recent dramatic deterioration in the economic situation – both domestically and internationally – the UK is entering uncharted territory with regard to the future demand for air travel." 
BAA's Plans to get through the Public Inquiry as fast as possible for their application for a second Stansted runway (in six months) were condemned by Stop Stansted Expansion. It began 15 April 2009.
The news that the Inspector appointed by the Government is looking to conduct the Inquiry at a "breakneck" pace was revealed in a note from the Planning Inspectorate issued ahead of the Pre Inquiry Meeting held on 10 November 2008, when the Inquiry programme and procedures were discussed at a public session. A further programming meeting was to be held on 19 January 2009.

"Running parallel sessions examining different subjects in different Inquiry rooms at the same time would severely compromise the community's ability to participate fully in the Inquiry" SSE says. "It would be impossible to conduct a fair and proper examination of BAA's plans by effectively excluding community representation by SSE and parish councils who are planning to play a leading role, said "Carol Barbone", campaign director."

Domain Name System

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a system used to convert a computer's host name into an IP address on the Internet. For example, if a computer needs to communicate with the web server "example.net", your computer needs the IP address of the web server "example.net". It is the job of the DNS to convert the host name to the IP address of the web server. It is sometimes called the Internet's telephone book because it converts a Website's name that people know to a number that the Internet actually uses.

The DNS is defined by Request for Comments (RFC) documents. These are technical documents about computer networks. The DNS is mainly defined by RFC 1034 and RFC 1035. There are later RFC which define changes to the system.

Domain names are made up of one or more parts, or "labels" that are joined and kept separate by dots, such as codice_1.

Let us imagine that a PC called "PC1" needs to connect to a server named "Server1". The following steps describe the basic DNS lookup process.

Eyrieux River

The Eyrieux River is a river in Europe. It flows into the Rhône River.

The Eyrieux River runs for . It passes through three different landscapes. A plateau is found above a commune called Le Cheylard. This plateau is marked by the sugarloaf cones of old volcanoes. This land is mostly used for cattle and sheep. In its middle section, down as far as Saint-Sauveur-de-Montagut and Les Ollières-sur-Eyrieux, the river is a torrent. This means that it flows very quickly and roughly. It has a lot of flash floods. The power made by this torrent was used first for silk mills. Now it is used for micro-hydroelectricity production. It is also a popular spot for canoeists. The river never dries up in summer, because there are many dams and barrages that give it a steady flow. The lower section to the Rhône, at Beauchastel and La Voulte-sur-Rhône, opens into a valley. There are many farms in the valley. Peach orchards grow here.

Grefrath

Grefrath is a municipality in the district of Viersen. It is found in the western part of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

Rorqual

Rorquals are the largest group of baleen whales, with nine species in two genera. They include the largest animal that has ever lived, the Blue Whale, which can reach 150 tonnes, and another that reaches 70 tons; even the smallest of the group, the Northern Minke Whale, reaches 9 tonnes.

Balaenoptera

Balaenoptera is the largest genus of the Rorqual whales, containing eight species, including the recently discovered Balaenoptera omurai in 2003. The only rorqual whale which is currently not classified as a member of the genus Balaenoptera is the Humpback Whale, "Megaptera novaeangliae".

Gary Lewis (musician)

Gary Lewis (born Gary Harold Lee Levitch on July 31, 1945 in Newark, New Jersey) is an American musician. He is the son of actor/director and comedian Jerry Lewis. He was the leader of a band called Gary Lewis & the Playboys.

Lewis and his band had several hit records during the 1960s, including "This Diamond Ring", "She's Just My Style", "Save Your Heart For Me", "Count Me In", and "Everybody Loves A Clown". Lewis played drums onstage, but Jim Keltner often played drums on the Playboys recordings. Most of their records were produced by Snuff Garrett. Lewis was also the band's lead singer.

Lewis included a tribute to his father in the song "Time Stands Still", imitating Jerry Lewis's familiar comic voice on the record, and he and the Playboys performed the theme song to his 1966 comedy film "Way... Way Out".

When Lewis was drafted into the United States Army in 1967, the Playboys disbanded. After he served in the Army, Lewis had no more hit records, but continued to perform at oldies concerts and charity shows, including some of the Muscular Dystrophy Association's annual telethons, hosted by Jerry Lewis.

Alois Alzheimer

Alois Alzheimer (14 June 1864 – 19 December 1915) was a German psychiatrist. He is credited with the first published case of "presenile dementia", which Emil Kraepelin would later identify as Alzheimer's disease.
On 25th of November 1901, Alzheimer started treating a new patient, called Auguste Deter. Auguste was married, and her husband brought her to the clinic, because within a year she had changed very much. She had started to become jealous, and was unable to perform simple household tasks. Alzheimer found out that the patient had little knowledge of where she was or about the time of day or the week. She also remembered few things about her life. When she was asked a question, the answer often had little to do with the question. Auguste Deter's mood changed rapidly. Alzheimer had seen similar symptoms with other patients he treated, but generally these were over 70 years old; Auguste Deter was only 51. Several times, Auguste Deter stated that she knew that she "had lost herself" and that she "was helpless". For this reason, Alzheimer originally said that this was the "disease of forgetting". Deter died in 1906. 


Goby

The gobies are teleost fish of the family Gobiidae. This is one of the largest families of fish, with more than 2,000 species in more than 200 genera. Most are relatively small, less than 10 cm (4 in) in length.

Although few are important as food for humans, they are of great significance as prey species for commercially important fish like cod, haddock, sea bass, and flatfish.

Mudskipper

Mudskippers are a type of fish. They are part of a fish family known as the gobies. They are amphibious fish: they can use their pectoral fins to "walk" on land. They are adapted to intertidal habitats. These are places where the tide of the ocean comes in and out. Most fish that live in these habitats hide under wet seaweed or in tidal pools to stay moist or wet when the tide goes out. Mudskippers are active when they are out of the water. They eat and interact with each other. They defend their territories.

Mudskippers are found in places that are tropical, subtropical and temperate. They live near the shores of in the Indo-Pacific and the Atlantic coast of Africa.

Mudskippers are different from their relatives, the gobies, in many ways. Gobies live only in the sea, but mudskippers live both on land and in water. They have made many adaptations to live on the land. These include:

This way of breathing is like how amphibians breathe. It is known as cutaneous air breathing. Another important adaptation that helps breathing while out of the water are their enlarged gill chambers. They keep a bubble of air there. These large gill chambers close tightly when the fish is above water. This keeps the gills moist and lets them to function. They act like a scuba diver's cylinders. They give oxygen for breathing also while on land.


Even when their burrow is underwater, mudskippers have an air pocket inside it. This lets them to breathe where there is little oxygen in the water.

The genus (a group of closely related species) "Periophthalmus" is by far the most diverse and widespread group of mudskipper. There are eighteen different types. "Periophthalmus argentilineatus" is one of the most widespread and well known species. It can be found in mangrove ecosystems and mudflats of East Africa and Madagascar east through the Sundarbans of Bengal, South East Asia to northern Australia, southeast China and southern Japan, up to Samoa and Tonga Islands.
It grows to a length of about 9.5 cm and is a carnivorous opportunist feeder, which means it will eat anything it comes upon. It feeds on small prey such as small crabs and other arthropods. Another species, "Periophthalmus barbarus", is the only goby that lives in the coastal areas of western Africa.


Return statement

A return statement is the information that part of a computer program gives to another part. In object-oriented programming, the term return is used by methods to perform an output. Much like when a button is pressed on a vending machine, then the item you bought comes out (the vending machine returns your item), and so when an object performs a method, something is returned. What is returned depends on an special identifier called a return type.

A return type is a required part of any method, because it tells the computer what the user wants to be returned to whatever used the method. If an integer was expected, then typically the method would have a return type of codice_1, as int is the common name for an integer in computer science. There are several return types that can be found to most programming languages.

Means a method returns an integer, a whole number.

Means a method returns a double value. This is the default method of using numbers with decimal points.

Sara Bareilles

Sara Bareilles (born December 7, 1979) is an American musician, singer-songwriter and pianist. She is well known for her song "Love Song" (2007) and "Gravity" (2007). "Love Song" comes from her first important album, "Little Voice" (2007). "Bottle It Up" (2008) is Bareilles' second single, which also comes from "Little Voice". Although "Little Voice" is her first popular album, Bareilles released the album "Careful Confessions" in 2004. It is technically her very first album, although it wasn't popular like "Little Voice". Sara sings in the contralto range, but sometimes can reach to the mezzo-soprano range.

Bareilles was born and raised in Eureka, California. Her mother is Bonnie Halvorsen (née Capellas), a funeral home worker. Her father is Paul Bareilles, an insurance adjuster. Bareilles has Italian, German, Portuguese, and French descent. Bareilles was raised as a Catholic. She participated in the high school choir, Limited Edition, and local community theater musical productions, including her high school's production of "Little Shop of Horrors" as Audrey.

When "Careful Confessions" was released, Bareilles still performed at small concerts, and did not get national recognition. However, she made a music video for her song "Fairytale" in 2005.

"Little Voice" was released July 3, 2007. That summer, iTunes released "Love Song" as a free single of the week. It quickly became popular and gained a lot of airplay.

On October 22, 2013 Bareilles released "Brave Enough: Live at the Variety Playhouse", her second live album.

In December 2013 "The Blessed Unrest" was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2014 Grammy Awards.

Method (computer programming)

In object-oriented programming, a method is a part of an object. A method allows the object to perform an action, whether this action is to modify itself or to return a value. An example is:
public int getOne() {

This syntax is the same in different programming languages such as Java and C#.

The codice_1 identifier means that this method is publicly accessible, that anyone is allowed to use this. In comparison, a method may be codice_2 or sometimes codice_3, protected means only specific parts of the same program are allowed to use this method, and never a human user. A privately accessible method only allows the object it belongs to, to edit it. This is used to give data security.

The codice_4 identifier means that the return type is an integer value.

From the Earth to the Moon

From the Earth to the Moon is a book by Jules Verne.

He tells of the adventures of three men, the Americans Barbicane and Nicholl, and one French man, Ardan. They want to go to the moon, and to do this, they make a very big cannon, with a very big "bullet". The bullet is the spaceship. They get caught in the moons orbit and the story ends there.

Before he died, Verne gave the manuscript to his nephew, telling him to look after it. "I'm sure that you will see travel to the moon. You will be able to judge my prediction".

Richard Seddon

Richard Seddon (22 June 1845 – 10 June 1906) was Prime Minister of New Zealand from 1893 through 1906. He is the longest serving Prime Minister of New Zealand. He introduced women's rights for his country in 1893, 25 years before the United Kingdom did.

Lewy body

Lewy body is a substance that stains eosin, and commonly found in Parkinson’s disease.
The main disease associated with the presence of Lewy bodies is Parkinson's disease. Lewy bodies are also present in neurons in dementia with Lewy bodies and the Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease, as well as Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome.


Severus Snape

Severus Snape is a character from J.K. Rowling's fictional book series Harry Potter. Snape is the Potions master at Hogwarts in the series. He is also known to be a Death Eater but after Voldemort started hunting James Potter and Lily J. Potter, the woman Snape had loved since he was a child, he asked Albus Dumbledore to find a safe place for the Potters to hide because he knew Voldemort wanted to kill their son, Harry Potter. As Dumbledore was not able to save the Potters, Snape's sorrow was extremely deep, he gained Dumbledore's trust. Snape was loyal to Dumbledore after this event. Snape killed Dumbledore in the sixth book on Dumbledore's request. Voldemort believed Snape killed him because Voldemort had planned Snape to do that. Snape had let it slip in the third book that Remus Lupin was a werewolf. 

Snape didn't kill himself after Lily's death only because of the promise that he made to Dumbledore about protecting Harry and the cause Lily had died for. Just before Snape's death in the seventh book Snape asks Harry to do a last thing for him, he asked Harry to take his tears and put them in the Pensieve to discover Snape’s real story.

The last thing Snape's eyes ever saw were Lily's green eyes. Later, Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley named their youngest son after Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape. Harry confesses to his son Albus Severus that Severus Snape was the bravest man at Slytherin house he ever knew even though while still at school, Snape had been the teacher that Harry had hated the most because of Snape's bad behaviour towards Harry. Snape was so mean to Harry because of Harry's father, James Potter, that had bullied Snape while they were at Hogwarts. Snape was more than a cruel, heartless Death Eater but rather a brave and tragic victim to the perils of love in the reign of a power obsessed and heartless dictator. 

In all of the Harry Potter movies, Snape is played by Alan Rickman.

Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration

Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration or Hallervorden Spatz disease is a rare disease. People with this disease have dementia, or extreme forgetfullness, and their face my twitch. Hallervorden-Spatz disease is degenerative brain disease, meaning the longer a person has it the worse the effects become. Scientists think it is caused by a build up of too much Iron in the brain. 

The effects of the disease usually start at a young age and often result in a quick death. Some effects include:




Extrapyramidal symptom

Extrapyramidal syndrome is when involuntary muscle movements occur in the face and neck. This may include lip smacking, tongue movements, blinking, and head or finger spasms. The patient may have difficulty moving his arms and legs, and slur their words.

It occurs when dopamine is not correctly regulated by the body. It is usually a reaction to medicines, but is also caused by Parkinson's disease or a head injury.


St Matthew Passion

The St Matthew Passion () is a musical composition written by Johann Sebastian Bach. The words tell the story of Jesus’s death on the cross as told in chapters 26 and 27 of the Gospel of Matthew in the Bible. The work is for a choir, solo voices and orchestra. Both the choir and the orchestra are divided into two sections: Chorus 1 and Chorus 2, Orchestra 1 and Orchestra 2.

The words are from the Bible and by the poet Picander. There were other composers who also wrote works called "St Matthew Passion", the most famous being Heinrich Schütz. However, Bach’s "St Matthew Passion " is thought by many musicians to be the greatest choral work ever written. Two other very great choral works by Bach are his "St John Passion " and "Mass in B minor ". 

The tradition of singing the story of Jesus' passion during Holy Week (the week before Easter) goes back many hundreds of years to a time when a priest would sing the story instead of speaking it. Later a tradition developed of letting it be sung by a choir. During the Baroque period the Passion oratorio developed. Bach's St. Matthew Passion, written in 1727, is the most famous work in this tradition. It was probably first performed on Good Friday (11 April) 1727 in the Thomaskirche in Leipzig, where Bach was Kapellmeister. He made some changes to it by 1736 and performed it again on 30 March 1736. After that it was almost completely forgotten until long after Bach’s death. Even Bach’s music in general was forgotten by most people. In 1829 the composer Felix Mendelssohn discovered the music of the "St Matthew Passion " and decided to perform a short version of it in Berlin. It immediately became extremely popular with the public and from then on Bach has always remained recognized as one of the greatest of all composers.

The words of Bach’s "St Matthew Passion " are partly taken straight from the Bible (Matthew Chapters 26-27) and partly made up by the poet Picander. The words from the Bible are used to tell the basic story. They are sung to recitative (music in speech rhythm) by a tenor soloist who is known as the evangelist (Matthew was an “evangelist” because he preached the message of Jesus). The words spoken by Jesus are sung by a baritone or bass soloist. The evangelist is accompanied by the continuo (an organ and a cello, double bass or bassoon). Jesus is accompanied by the strings.

Between the sections of recitatives there are arias, each of which is sung by one of the four soloists: a soprano, an alto, a tenor and a bass. The arias often have an introductory movement called “arioso” which in musical style is something between a recitative and an aria. The arias are accompanied by the orchestra, often with one instrument playing an important solo. The words of the arioso and arias comment on what is happening in the story and describe what is going on in the people’s minds. 

The choir, divided into two sections (“double choir”), sing some movements in which they represent the crowd of people in the story. Some of these movements, such as the opening one, are quite long, others are very short indeed. In some of these movements there is a vocal soloist, and the choir are commenting on what the soloist is singing about. In addition to the main choir there is a small choir which sings a chorale tune on top of the music during the first movement (this is called a “ripieno”). Sometimes a boys’ choir is used for this.

There are also several chorales which are sung by the whole choir. These are like hymn tunes. It is likely that in Bach’s time the congregation would have joined in singing these, as they were chorales which were often sung at church services.

During some of the choral movements there are very small sections for a solo voice. These represent one person from the crowd. These may be sung by soloists from the choir. So, as well as Jesus, there are small parts for Judas, Peter, two high priests, Pontius Pilate, Pilate's wife, two witnesses and two "ancillae" (maids). These small parts can be sung by different soloists, but in some performances one soloist (possibly one who is also singing the arias) may take several of these parts.

In the tradition of these musical Passions the Resurrection is not mentioned at all. The story ends with the chorus shedding tears after Jesus has been put to death.

The instruments in the orchestra are string instruments (violins, violas, cellos and double basses), organs (one for each choir), two flutes, two oboes and bassoon. Orchestra I plays with Choir I and Orchestra II plays with Choir II. There are some extra instruments as well: two recorders, three different kinds of oboe and a viola da gamba.

Bach’s "St Matthew Passion" takes nearly 3 ½ hours if it is performed without any cuts. It is divided into two parts. There is usually a long interval between each part so that musicians and audience can have a meal before coming back refreshed for the second part.

The "St Matthew Passion " and the "St John Passion " are both very great works. They are different in character. The "St John Passion" is very dramatic, enjoying the drama of the story. The "St Matthew Passion " is more gentle and thoughtful, although it also has some dramatic moments.


Oatmeal

Oatmeal is a meal made of oats. It is normally made for breakfast. Oatmeal can also be steel-cut oats, crushed oats, or rolled oats. Occasionally, brown sugar, honey, jelly, or other items are added to oatmeal. It makes a tasty treat for all to enjoy. It is looked forward to as a light meal.

St John Passion

The St John Passion (), BWV 245, is a musical composition by Johann Sebastian Bach. The words tell the story of Jesus’s death on the cross as told in the Gospel of John in the Bible. The work is for a choir, solo voices and orchestra.

The "St. John Passion" was first performed in 1724 in the St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig. The words are from three sources: the Bible (telling the story), by two poets from Hamburg, mostly by Barthold Heinrich Brockes, and from chorales which were well-known to German church goers at the time. There were other composers who also wrote works called "St John Passion", the most famous being Heinrich Schütz. However, Bach’s "St John Passion" is thought by many musicians to be one of the greatest choral works ever written. Two other great choral works by Bach are his "St Matthew Passion" and "Mass in B minor ".

Mass in B minor

The Mass in B minor (BWV 232) (usually called Hohe Messe in German) is a large composition by Johann Sebastian Bach for choir, orchestra and vocal soloists. The words are in Latin and Greek (first movement only). They are the traditional words of the Mass.

Bach did not plan the Mass in B minor as one continuous work. Parts of it were composed in 1724. He put the movements together just before his death. It is one of the greatest musical works ever written.

Reza Shah Pahlavi

Reza Shah Pahlavi (b. Reza Khan; March 16, 1878 – July 26, 1944) was the Shah of Iran from 1925 to 1941, when he abdicated (declared that was no longer king) and passed the position on to his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. In 1921, he and Seyed Ziya-al-Din Tabatabaei launched a coup d'état overthrowing the Qajar dynasty. Reza Shāh then became minister of war, and eventually became king, which started the Pahlavi dynasty. Because of his friendship with Adolf Hitler, the British suspected that Nazi Germany was conspiring with Iran and ordered Reza Shāh to abdicate, which he then did.

Reza Shah was originally Reza Khan, a military officer of the Persian Cossack Brigade who could not read, and taught himself.

Armageddon (2008)

Armageddon (2008) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event made by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which took place on December 14, 2008 at the HSBC Arena in Buffalo, New York. Seven matches took place at the event.

The main rivalry on the Raw brand was between John Cena and Chris Jericho, with the two fighting over the World Heavyweight Championship. At Survivor Series, Cena returned to the WWE after a neck injury and defeated Jericho to win the championship. On the November 24 episode of "Raw", Jericho defeated Randy Orton and Batista (David Bautista) in a Triple Threat match to earn a championship match against Cena at Armageddon.

The main rivalry on the SmackDown brand was between Edge, Triple H and Jeff Hardy over the WWE Championship. At Survivor Series, Edge returned to the WWE after a three-month absence after being announced as a replacement for Hardy, who was originally scheduled to face the defending champion Triple H and Vladimir Kozlov (Oleg Prudius) in a Triple Threat match for the championship, but was found unconscious in his hotel and did not compete in the match. Edge pinned Triple H and won the championship. On the November 29 edition of "SmackDown", General Manager Vickie Guerrero announced a "Beat the Clock Sprint" tournament, where the one of the three competitors (Triple H, Hardy, and Kozlov) would face Edge at Armageddon for the WWE Championship. Both Triple H and Hardy beat their opponents at twelves minute and thirteen seconds (12:13). The next week, Vickie Guerrero announced that WWE board members had decided Edge would have to defend the title against both Triple H and Jeff Hardy.

ECW's main rivalry was between ECW Champion Matt Hardy and Vladimir Kozlov. After Hardy had stopped Kozlov from being able to beat his brother's time in the "Beat the Clock Sprint", Kozlov would gain revenge in the following weeks on "SmackDown" and "ECW" by assaulting Hardy, finally challenging him to a match, in which Hardy accepted.

Another match that took place at Armageddon was the finals of a 8-man tournament for a WWE Intercontinental Championship title shot against the current champion, William Regal. On the November 11th Edition of "Raw" Stephanie McMahon ordered a tournament to determine who would be the next person to receive a shot at the title. The first round saw four standard matches: Kofi Kingston (Kofi Mensah) advance over Kane, due to Kane getting disqualified. CM Punk defeated Snitsky (Gene Snitsky) by pinning him following a GTS (Go To Sleep). John Morrison (John Hennigan) defeated Finlay (Dave Finlay) following a pin after an Enzuigiri. The final match of the opening round saw Rey Mysterio defeat The Miz (Mike Mizanin). The second round was started by Punk defeating John Morrison with the GTS, and Mysterio defeated Kingston by pinning him with an Oklahoma roll. As a result, CM Punk would wrestle Rey Mysterio in the finals of the tournament.

Samak Sundaravej (13 June 1935 - 24 November 2009) was the 25th Prime Minister of Thailand, Minister of Defence and also the leader of People’s Power Party. He was named by the mass media as "Uncle Mak" or "Mr. Rose Apple Nose" because of the shape of his nose. He was forced to resign as prime minister because he was also acting as chef on a TV show.

Songkran

Songkran is a festival held every year in Thailand on April 13. This is Thailand's New Year's party. It celebrates the traditional New Year in the Thai calendar. The festival lasts all over the country for 3 days. However, in the northern city of Chiang Mai, it is six days. Long ago, Thai people used a different calendar from other places in the world. Their year started around April 13. Now, their year starts on January 1, but they still celebrate the New Year from April 13 to April 15. 

People celebrate Songkran by throwing water at each other on the streets. It is exciting. It is also known as the Water Festival. Almost everyone gets wet, even the police. People put water on old people's hands. The only people who do not get wet are monks and babies. People throw water for many reasons. The most important one is to have a clean body and mind for the New Year. In Thailand, it is very hot at that time of year. So, people do not get angry when they get wet. People believe that water will wash away bad luck. It is also a time to visit family and give gifts. People go to the temple to pray and give food to monks. They also clean the Buddha images in temples with water and perfumes.

In Thailand, most people are Buddhist, so they keep statues of Buddha. On April 14, people dance and sing in the streets. They also carry their statues. They throw water at the Buddha statues to clean them. The water smells nice because it has flowers in it. The streets smell good during Songkran. Sometimes there is a contest to choose the most beautiful woman.

And the legend of the important ladies on Songkran Day is Nang Songkran. The seven daughters of Kabil Maha Phrom. They have their own names, but most of people called them as Nang Songkran or the Songkran Ladies and they ride on the animals. She stands on the animal’s back if she comes in the morning rides on its back if she comes in the afternoon. For instance, in the year 1951, the Songkran Lady named Kimitha appeared on the 13th April at 1 o'clock 17 minutes and 56 seconds in the morning. She reclined with her eyes closed on the back of a buffalo. The time she appears is when the sun first enters the sign of Aries which heralds the beginning of Songkran New Year's Day..

Another thing people do at this time is they clean their houses. They also wear new clothes. All these things show that people are ready for the New Year.

Zwickau (district)

The rural district Zwickau is a district in west Saxony. It was founded at August 1, 2008. It consists of the (former) Chemnitzer Land Rural District and Zwickauer Land Rural District. It is the smallest district of Saxony but also the district with the highest population density of Saxony.

The district was formed on August 1, 2008. This was the result of an administration reform in Saxony. The rural district Zwickau was built up by the Chemnitzer Land Rural District, Zwickauer Land Rural District and the town of Zwickau. The county seat of the district is the biggest city Zwickau. However, the former county seats of the different districts were kept as outpost. Those are namely Glauchau, Limbach-Oberfrohna, Werdau and Hohenstein-Ernstthal.

In July 2008, there were 25,026 people jobless. That means there was a rate of unemployment of 11.1 percent. It was the lowest jobless rate of the Regierungsbezirk Chemnitz. Because of the end of the schoolyear the unemployment rate of pupils rose up.

In the rural district Zwickau is one Study Academy (called: Berufsakademie Glauchau) nine vocational schools and some grammar schools. Overall there are 124 schools. In Chemnitz and Zwickau are different Universities.

The "Kreistag" was elected on 8 June 2008. The current chief administrative officer of the Zwickau Rural District is Christoph Scheurer.

Carnival of the Animals

The Carnival of the Animals (French: "Le Carnavál de Animaûx") is a musical composition by Camille Saint-Saëns. It is one of the best known pieces of classical music for children. 

Saint-Saëns wrote the "Carnival of the Animals" as a distraction while composing his "Symphony No. 3". "Carnival" was performed at a small gathering of friends. Saint-Saëns did not want the general public to hear it, because he did not want to be thought of as someone who wrote jokey pieces. He wanted to be thought of as a serious composer. Just one movement was published during his lifetime: the famous Swan movement for solo cello. The rest of the work was not performed until a year after Saint-Saëns’ death.

Following a disastrous concert tour of Germany in 1893, Saint-Saëns withdrew to a small Austrian village, where he composed The Carnival of the Animals in February 1894. It is scored for two pianos, two violins, viola, cello, double bass, Bass clarinet, saxophone, snare drumflute (and piccolo), clarinet (C and B♭), glass harmonica, and xylophone.

There are 14 short movements, with a short introduction. Saint-Saëns arranged it for an orchestra consisting of flute doubling piccolo, clarinet (B flat and C), two pianos, glass harmonica, xylophone, two violins, viola, cello and double bass. Today it is often performed with a full orchestra of strings, and with a glockenspiel instead of a glass harmonica, which is an unusual instrument.

After an introduction the pianos introduce a march theme. They imitate the roar of the lions. 
This music sounds like hens clucking (the strings) and a cock crowing (the clarinet).
The two pianos seem to go wild with scales rushing up and down madly.
This movement for strings and piano is very slow, like a tortoise. Saint-Saëns makes a musical joke here: the tune is the same tune as the famous 'Can-Can' from Jacques Offenbach's operetta "Orpheus in the Underworld", but played very slowly.
This double bass solo with piano accompaniment makes the elephant sound heavy and clumsy. In the middle section the elephant tries to dance a waltz. This is also a musical joke - the tune is taken from Felix Mendelssohn's "Incidental Music to A Midsummer Night's Dream" and Hector Berlioz's "Dance of the Sylphs". These two pieces are meant to be played on higher sounding instruments, like the flute and violin, but in this piece, the tune is played on the double bass, the lowest sounding instrument in the orchestra/
The two pianos hop about gracefully like kangaroos.
This is very graceful music with the tune played on the flute, accompanied by strings, with occasional glissandi (slides) on the glass harmonica.
The “Persons with Long Ears” are actually donkeys. It is a very short piece, and it is played on two violins which imitate the “hee-haw” sound of the donkey. Some people think that Saint-Saëns is making a joke about music critics, who bray like donkeys.
The pianos play gentle chords, like someone walking quietly through a forest. Now and again the clarinet plays two notes which sound like the call of the cuckoo. In the original sheet music, it is said that the clarinet player should move off stage, to make it sound more like the cuckoo is calling from a distance.
The flute has a very delicate, fast tune accompanied by strings and pianos. It sounds like birds flying in an aviary (bird cage). 
This is another joke, because “pianists” are people who play the piano, they are not animals. Saint-Saëns makes them seem rather stupid as they practise their scales. When this movement was first published, a note was included that said that "Performers should imitate the playing of beginners, and their awkwardness". Because of this, in some performances, the pianists become out of time with each other on purpose.
The xylophone plays a fast tune which sounds like skeletons playing. Saint-Saëns is making a joke about himself, because he uses a tune from one of his own works: the "Danse Macabre". There are bits of other tunes as well: "Ah! vous dirai-je, Maman" (known in the English-speaking world as "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"), the French nursery rhymes "Au Clair de la Lune" and "J'ai du bon tabac", the popular anthem "Partant pour la Syrie" as well as the aria "Una Voce Poco Fa" from Rossini's "Barber of Seville". Saint-Saëns was saying that these tunes were old-fashioned (like fossils).
This is one of the most famous of all tunes for the cello. It is a lovely tune which sounds like a swan swimming gracefully along. There is a famous solo ballet dance called "The Dying Swan" which is set to this tune.
All the instruments join in the Finale which has bits from nearly all the movements.

Arthur slowly got stronger until July 16 when it reached its highest winds, which were at 60 miles per hour. Wind shear caused Arthur to die shortly later. The extratropical low was last seen on July 19 while it was near Greenland.

Hurricane Isidore was the strongest hurricane in the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season. Isidore affected the Windward Islands, Venezuela, Jamaica, Cuba, Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula, parts of the United States. Some forecasters showed it possible for Isidore to make landfall in the United States as a category 4 hurricane. But since Isidore moved slow over Mexico, it struck the Louisiana as only a tropical storm. 

Hurricane Isidore killed 22 people and left $1.3 billion in damage.

The name "Isidore" was retired, which means it will never be used again for an Atlantic hurricane. It was replace with the "Ike", which was used in 2008 and was also retired.

Tropical Storm Allison

Tropical Storm Allison was one of the worst tropical storms in the history of the United States. Most of the damage was in Texas. It was mostly the Houston Area. Allison caused more than $5 billion in damage. Allison also killed 55 people in the United States. Allison is the first tropical storm in the Atlantic Ocean to have its name retired without reaching hurricane strength.

The beginning of Allison was a tropical wave that moved off of Africa on May 21. The wave moved all the most across the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea. It crossed South America and entered the Pacific Ocean. The wave crossed over southern Mexico and entered the Gulf of Mexico. The wave moved north until June 4, where it became Tropical Storm Allison. It skipped being a tropical depression while forming. On the same day Allison reached her top winds, which were at 60 mph. Allison weakened down to 50 mph winds. 
On June 5 Allison made landfall in Freeport, Texas with winds at 50 mph. Allison quickly weakened to a depression. Allison moved very slowly until Allison reached Lufkin, Texas. Allison moved very slowly back to the Gulf of Mexico. Allison did not reach the Gulf of Mexico until June 9. Dry air caused Allison to become a subtropical depression. On June 11 Allison made landfall in Louisiana without becoming a tropical depression or tropical storm. Clouds moved close to the center of Allison and Allison became a subtropical storm, while over Louisiana. Allison quickly weakened back to a subtropical depression.

It was the first tropical storm in the history of Atlantic hurricanes to have its name retired and was the only tropical storm to have its name retired until Tropical Storm Erika in 2015.

Hurricane Iris

Hurricane Iris was the third major hurricane of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season. Hurricane Iris was also the second storm of 2001 to strike Belize. Iris was a category 4 hurricane when it struck Belize, but damage was rather low. It is likely because Iris weakened very quickly over land.

Eurasian lynx

The Eurasian lynx "(Lynx lynx)" is a medium-sized cat native to Europe (Including Finland, Sweden, Norway) and Asia. It is one of the largest predators in Europe and Asia. It is the largest of the lynxes with a length of 80130 cm.

Eurasian lynx are the largest of the four lynx species. They are one of the largest predators in Europe, after brown bears and grey wolves.

They weigh from 18 to 36 kg and body length is 80 to 130 cm. Males are larger and more robust than females.

During summer, lynx have a short, reddish or brown coat, while in the winter the coat becomes a thicker and silkier fur, colored silver-gray to grayish brown.

Lynx are solitary creatures. The only long lasting relationship they form is between mother and cubs. They are most active during early morning and evening. Lynx are terrestrial mainly, but they are able and adapted to climb and swim.

Eurasian lynx can survive up to 17 years in the wild and about 24 years when captive. The juvenile rate of mortality is high.

Lynx prey mostly on small to fairly large sized mammals and birds. Among prey for the species are hares, rabbits, marmots, squirrels, dormice, other rodents, grouse, red foxes, wild boar, foxes, chamois, moose, roe deer, red deer, reindeer and other ungulates. It is a carnivore, consuming about one to two kg of meat every day.

Although taking on larger prey presents a risk to the animal, the bounty provided by killing them can outweigh the risks. The Eurasian lynx thus prefers fairly large ungulate prey, especially during winter when small prey is less abundant. They are the only "Lynx" species in which ungulates provide more of their diet than lagomorphs or rodents. Where common, roe deer are the preferred prey species for the lynx. Even where roe deer are quite uncommon, as in Sweden, the deer are still the favored prey species, though in summer smaller prey and occasional domestic sheep are eaten. In parts of Finland, introduced White-tailed deer are eaten mostly regularly. In some areas of Poland and Austria, red deer are the preferred prey and, in Switzerland, chamois are taken. They will also feed on carrion when it is available. Adult lynx require of meat per day, and may take several days to fully consume some of their larger prey.

Found in the Chinese provinces and Northern Pakistan.

Most Eurasian lynxes are in Russia.

In 2008, there were about 1905–2060 lynxes in Finland.

In Sweden there are about 1,400.

In Norway there are between 409 and 439.


Hassocks

Hassocks is a large village in West Sussex, England. 

It can be found about north of Brighton, and nearly 7000 people live there. Hassocks has grown since the 19th century, when work started on the London to Brighton railway. 
The village became better known after 2 April 1839 when the first railway line was laid between London and Brighton. Over 6,000 workmen were hired for up to two years building, blasting and clearing rubble beneath the South Downs to create Clayton Tunnel. It is the second longest tunnel on the London to Brighton Line, some 1¼ miles long and below ground. The opening of Hassocks Gate as the railway station in 1841 saw the beginning of the village that is known today. In 1861 there was a collision between two trains, which killed 23 people and injured 176 others.

Today Hassocks has lots of shops and a well-used community centre called Adastra Hall. It is quite expensive to buy a house in Hassocks, though it is not quite as expensive as neighbouring Ditchling and Hurstpierpoint. These villages have many nice, older buildings whereas Hassocks village centre was mainly built after World War Two.

Hassocks railway station serves the village. There are regular train services to London and Brighton. 

Hassocks Infant School is a maintained infant school for pupils aged 4 to 7. It currently caters for around 180 pupils. The school is centrally located in the village. 

After leaving the Infant School children in the main go onto Windmills School in Dale Avenue which caters for years 3–6. 

Secondary education for the village and surrounding areas is looked after by Downlands Community School. 

A sports hall and AstroTurf football pitch were constructed at Downlands Community School once. 

There is a windmill being worked on by lots of local volunteers to try and get it back to working condition again as it was completely ruined. The windmill made flour for the first time in 100 years in October 2008.

Hassocks's twin towns are:

Duvet

A duvet is a type of bedding used as a blanket, on a bed. They are normally made of a cotton cover, filled with feathers and down or man-made fibres such as polyester, microfibre and hollowfibre. They are soft and comfortable, and keeps the person who's under it warm when sleeping. Additional bed throws (sometimes called a 'snug') may be added in the autumn/fall to add an extra layer of warmth. 

The thickness of the duvet is measured by a tog rating. The higher the tog, the warmer the duvet will be. The warmest duvet on the market is currently a 15 tog. Most people who have heated houses will use a 4.5 tog duvet all year round, but sometimes in the autumn/winter people will upgrade to either a 7.0 or a 9.0 tog.

Daguerreotype

A Daguerreotype is a method of creating photographs that is no longer in general use. A man called Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre invented the daguerreotype process in France in 1839. 

The new type of photography became very popular very quickly as it was capable of capturing a "truthful likeness." By 1850, there were over seventy daguerreotype studios in New York alone.

However the popularity of the daguerreotype was short lived as other cheaper processes were invented. By the late 1850s faster and less expensive processes such as the ambrotype, became available. A drawback of the Daguerreotype was that there was no negative from which to produce lots of images. Each picture was therefore unique, the only way to get a copy was to rephotograph the image.

Dowry

A dowry (also known as trousseau or tocher) is the money, goods, or estate that is given to a woman at the time of her marriage. A dowry creates a fund for her support in case her husband dies. The dowry eventually goes to her sons and daughters of this marriage. At different times in history, a dowry was needed to prove that the marriage was real. Sometimes the woman controlled her dowry throughout her life. Other times, her husband took control of the dowry.

Dowry started as gifts that were handed out to the bride at the time of marriage to make her stay at in-laws place more comfortable. It has hence taken an ugly turn, many parts of India still have a high incidence of dowry demands. Dowries have been illegal in India since 1961, but 90% of Indian marriages still have them. Many people still continue dowry system for their own uses . Some states with a very poor reputation with regards to dowry are - Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, and Tamil Nadu. This is a sad reality in Indian marriages and has gone unchecked. 35,493 brides were killed in India between 2017 and 2022 for bringing in insufficient dowry.

Philip IV of France

Philip IV (French: "Philippe IV"; 23 June 1268 — 29 November 1314) nicknamed the Fair (French: "le Bel"), the Handsome (French: "le Beau"), and the Iron King (French: "le Roi Fer") was the King of France from 1285 until his death in 1314. As a result of his marriage to Queen Joan I of Navarre, he was also the King of Navarre and Count of Champagne (as Philip I) from their marriage in 1284 until Joan's death in 1305. He was the second son of King Philip III of France and Isabella of France. As the second son, he was never expected to become king. However, his older brother Louis died in 1276 when Philip was eight years old. Therefore, Philip became the Dauphin. In 1285, his father died and Philip became king.

Philip, seeking to reduce the wealth and power of the nobility and clergy, relied instead on skillful civil servants, such as Guillaume de Nogaret and Enguerrand de Marigny, to govern the kingdom. The king, who sought an uncontested monarchy, compelled his upstart vassals by wars and restricted their feudal privileges, paving the way for the transformation of France from a feudal country to a centralized early modern state. Internationally, Philip’s ambitions made him highly influential in European affairs, and for much of his reign he sought to place his relatives on foreign thrones. Princes from his house ruled in Hungary, and he tried and failed to make another relative the Holy Roman Emperor.

The most notable conflicts of Philip's reign include a dispute with the English over King Edward I's fiefs in southwestern France, and a war with the County of Flanders, who had rebelled against French royal authority and humiliated Philip at the Battle of the Golden Spurs in 1302. The war with the Flemish resulted in Philip's ultimate victory, after which he received a significant portion of Flemish cities, which were added to the crown lands along with a vast sum of money. 

Domestically, his reign was marked by struggles with the Jews and the Knights Templar. In heavy debt to both groups, Philip saw them as a "state within the state" and a recurring threat to royal power. In 1306 Philip expelled the Jews from France, followed by the total destruction of the Knights Templar the next year in 1307. To further strengthen the monarchy, Philip tried to tax and take control of the French clergy, leading to a violent dispute with Pope Boniface VIII. The ensuing conflict saw the pope's residence at Anagni attacked in September 1303 by French forces with the support of the Colonna family. Boniface was captured and held hostage for a number of days. This eventually resulted in the transfer of the papal court to the enclave of Avignon in 1309.

His final year saw a scandal amongst the royal family, known as the Tour de Nesle affair, in which Philip's three daughters-in-law were accused of adultery. His three sons were successively kings of France: Louis X, Philip V, and Charles IV. Their rapid successive deaths without surviving sons of their own would compromise the future of the French royal house, which had until then seemed secure, precipitating a succession crisis that would eventually lead to the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453).

Philip was a successful king. His long struggle with the Roman papacy ended with the transfer of the Curia to Avignon, France, beginning the Avignon Papacy (1309–77). He also secured French royal power by wars on barons and neighbours and by restriction of feudal usages. 

He was, by all accounts, an impressive ruler. Some Italian writers detested him and his line, but most contemporaries acknowledged his piety and good intentions, although many of them disapproved of his wars, his taxes, and his influential advisers. He left behind a stable and a powerful country.

Oldland Mill

Oldland Mill is an 18th century windmill. It can be found in the village of Keymer, near Hassocks, West Sussex.

Oldland Mill was built somewhere around 1700, the earliest record of a windmill in the area dates from 1703. The mill was originally an open trestle mill, the roundhouse being added at a later date. Records show a mill stood in Keymer in 1755 and the mill was marked on a map dated 1783, but not shown on one dated 1795. The 1801 National Defence Schedule records the mill but the 1813 Ordnance Survey and Greenwood's 1829 map omit the mill. Records show that the mill was standing in 1828. Oldland Mill was working by wind until 1912. The mill began to fall into disrepair in the early part of the 20th century and continued to deteriorate.

The Sussex Archaeological Society acquired the mill in 1927 and repairs were carried out by E Hole and Sons of Burgess Hill in 1934. In 1976, at the Annual General Meeting of the Hassocks Amenity Association, there was a talk was given on the work of Weald and Downland Open Air Museum. The question of how to preserve Oldland Mill was raised. The mill was then in the ownership of the Sussex Archaeological Society. The mill was looked at in 1977 by millwrights Vincent Pargeter and Edwin Hole and found to be close to collapse. Following negotiations with the Sussex Archaeological Society in 1979 the Hassocks Amenity Association leased the mill in 1980 and began a period of volunteer led restoration.

The first working party on 2 August 1980 cleared rubbish around the mill and made a temporary repair to the roof of the roundhouse. In 1981, the two remaining sails and stock were removed. The mill was restored over the next ten years, with much of the framing being replaced, including the trestle, crown tree, breast, tail and side frames. Since then the mill has benefited from a grant and substantial work has been completed. The mill was stripped to her bare essentials and many new parts completely and accurately built from scratch to replace rotten parts. The whole mill has been reclad and the four sails have been lifted into position. The mill ground its first batch of corn for many decades in October 2008. Today the mill is looked after by The Oldland Mill Trust, a registered charity.

Golden Balls

Golden Balls is a British television game show which was broadcast at 5.00pm to 6.00pm on ITV between June 2007 and December 2009 and repeated until February 2010 and at 3.00pm to 4.00pm on Challenge (repeats) from January 2010. It is presented by Jasper Carrott and is filmed at the BBC Television Centre. After 25 February 2008, the show was sponsored by ITV Bingo (powered by Party Gaming). It is still shown on "Challenge".

At the back of the studio is the "Golden Bank", which is basically the same as lottery machines. Jasper starts the game by starting the ball machine, where 100 golden balls containing varied values from £10, to the £75,000 golden ball are. 12 of the golden balls are randomly drawn from the ball machine. But Amanda Grant, (The Balls Assistant), puts 4 "killers" into the bunch. This means that 16 golden balls, cash and killers, are shared equally between all 4 of the contestants who get 4 golden balls each. 2 for the front row and 2 for the back row. Once the contestant has been introduced, he/she shows Jasper and the other 3 contestants what they are. This is repeated with all the other 3 players.

The back row is kept secret to their owner,(who has to say what they claim is there), until the players secretly vote for the weakest player, and the player with the most votes is voted off.

The 3 remaining contestants' balls are put back into the ball machine by Amanda. 2 new cash balls and 1 killer are added into the game. Each contestant still gets balls at random, but in round 2 it is 2 for the front row and 3 for the back.

Again all the 3 contestants show their front balls to the other players. Then they say what they claim is on the back row. The contestants each vote for the weakest player off, and the player with the most votes is "binned".

Again the golden balls that the contestants bring through to the final, are put back into the ball machine. Again Amanda puts 1 more killer into the game. There are 11 balls, that are placed onto a table with 5 golden slots for the balls to win, and a hole for the balls to bin. The 2 contestants take it in turns to pick a ball to bin, (which means it is out of the game), and pick a ball to win, (which goes into 1 of the 5 winning golden slots).

If they get say the £75,000 ball, then the £9,500 ball into the winning slots and then get a killer, it will take a zero off the accumalated total. Once they get the number of money in the jackpot total for the day and have all 5 balls into the golden 5 slots, the contestants have to negotiate "Split Or Steal".

Both contestants have 2 balls in front of them. 1 of them has the word "Split" inside it and the other has the word "Steal" inside it. If 1 of the contestants decides to Split and the other Steals, the player who Steals goes home with all of the money and the player who Splits goes home with nothing. If both players Split, they both split the jackpot total. If both contestants steal, they both go home with nothing.

Jasper asks the players to look inside both of the golden balls, to make sure they know which one is which. Once they know what they are, Jasper lets the players discuss what they are going to do for a short while. He then asks the players to pick 1 of the 2 balls in front of them. Jasper then counts down from 3, and the players reveal either their Split or their Steal ball.

The ending of the programme is usually signified with Jasper Carrott saying "It's goodbye from ([the ball's assistant Amanda Grant, who say goodbye]), and it's goodbye from me: goodbye!"

At the beginning of each game, Jasper tells the viewers and contestants that there are 100 golden balls in the Golden Bank. Below are the 101 cash values seen at least once up to 30 January 2009:

For example, Tropical Depression One formed on May 25. This season was very active with two depressions, six tropical storms, seven hurricanes, and one major hurricane. At that time it was the most active hurricane season.

This season was less deadly and damaging than other seasons, with only 116 deaths, and $150 million. The few deaths and little bit of damage were because most of the storms were relatively weak, and because most of the storms stayed at sea.

But the National Hurricane Center did not call it a tropical storm because the pressure was at 1015, which is very high for a tropical storm. Two moved sharply northeast before it died two days later, on July 26.

Hurricane Andrew was the strongest hurricane of the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season. It started on August 16. Later it hit land twice in Florida and once in Louisiana. Andrew caused nearly $26 billion in damage. This made it, at the time, the costliest hurricane in the history of the United States.

Bonnie started on September 17. It moved mostly east across the Atlantic and passed into the Azores before it died. The hurricane caused no damage, but may have killed one person in the Azores. 
Hurricane Charley started on September 21 in the far eastern Atlantic Ocean. It became a category 2 hurricane and passed into the Azores. Charley died on September 27.

Danielle started on September 22. It soon became a tropical storm. Tropical Storm Danielle made landfall in the Delmarva Peninsula before it died on September 26. The storm killed two people. 

Tropical Depression Seven started on September 25 about halfway between Africa and South America. Seven lasted nearly a week before it died on October 1.

Earl started on September 26 as a depression. This depression headed for Florida and became a tropical storm. It reversed course before hitting land in Florida. Tropical Storm Earl died on October 3.

Frances started on October 23 as a tropical storm and quickly became a hurricane. It took a path far from land. Hurricane Frances died on October 27.

Many species are cultivated as ornamental plants, and many cultivars have been bred. 


Hurricane Ismael

Hurricane Ismael was a weak hurricane that formed during the 1995 Pacific hurricane season. The storm formed on September 12, 1995. It became a hurricane on September 14, while it was located off the coast of Mexico. It moved to the north, and made landfall in Sinaloa. Ismael quickly weakened over land, and died out on September 16 over northwestern Mexico.

In the ocean, the storm caused waves that were up to 30 feet (9 m) high. The hurricane wrecked 52 ships and killed 57 fishermen. On land, Ismael caused 59 deaths in Mexico. The hurricane destroyed thousands of houses, leaving 30,000 people without homes. The storm reached the United States where it caused heavy rainfall in parts of New Mexico. It was the deadliest hurricane in the 1995 season.

The storm that eventually became Hurricane Ismael started off the southern coast of Guatemala on September 9. As it grew, it moved to the west-northwest. After a few days with no activity, a low pressure area developed off the coast of Mexico. Late on September 12, it formed into Tropical Depression Ten. At this time, the storm was about south-southwest of Manzanillo, Colima. The depression moved to the northwest, and strengthened to a tropical storm early on September 13.

Because of the influence of a nearby weather system over Baja California, Ismael slowly turned to the north. Tropical Storm Ismael became stronger as it moved northward. Ismael continued to grow, and on September 14, it became a hurricane.

An eye began to form inside of the storm, and six hours after becoming a hurricane, it reached its peak strength. Ismael then sped up as it moved to the northwest. The storm passed just east of Cabo San Lucas on September 15. The hurricane made landfall in the state of Sinaloa on September 15. Ismael quickly lost strength over land, and it died out on September 16. The remains of Ismael continued moving to the north. Rain from the storm reached parts of the United States.

At first, weather forecasters expected the hurricane to stay over the ocean. However, when they later found out that the storm would affect land, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Manzanillo, Colima, to Cabo Corrientes. The warning was later extended to Los Mochis and another one was given out for part of the east coast of Baja California Sur. Forecasters then issued a hurricane warning from Mazatlán to Los Mochis. Before the storm arrived, 1,572 people moved to emergency shelters.

Hurricane Ismael caused waves that were 30 feet (9 m) high over the Gulf of California. Many fishermen were not prepared for the hurricane. Because of this, 52 boats were destroyed, of which 20 sank. About 57 fishermen died off the shore; some washed up on shore. Another 150 fishermen survived the storm by waiting on islands or sandbars. Navy rescue teams searched for days off the coast of Mexico to find victims and survivors.

The storm dropped moderate to heavy rainfall, which reached 7.76 inches (197 mm) in Sinaloa. The heavy rain caused flooding in four municipalities. In one area, the hurricane destroyed 373 houses and damaged 4,790 others. The storm left 177 houses without drinking water, and led to lots of power outages. Damage was very bad where the hurricane made landfall. In Los Mochis, the winds from Ismael knocked down houses and telephone poles. A total of 59 people were killed in Sinaloa.

Ismael produced heavy rainfall farther to the north. Very bad flooding was reported in Huatabampo. Across Sonora, the winds destroyed 4,728 houses and removed the roofs from 6,827 homes. The hurricane also ruined 107 schools. The hurricane damaged about 100 miles (165 km) of roads. About 83 sq. miles (215 km²) of crop lands were damaged.

Rain from what was left of Ismael reached southwestern Arizona and southern New Mexico in the United States. The storm also caused heavy rainfall near the border between New Mexico and Texas. The rainfall caused flooding on roads and in buildings. Several roads were damaged and closed. In Lubbock, Texas, the rainfall caused flash flooding, which forced many roads to be shut down. Moisture from the storm went as far east as the Mid-Atlantic States.

Because the damage from the storm was so bad, the name "Ismael" was retired. The name was replaced with "Israel", which was used for a storm during the 2001 Pacific hurricane season. After Hurricane Ismael passed, officials gave out 4,800 sheets, 500 cushions, and 1,500 blankets to people who were affected by the storm. Divers helped to recover sunken ships and drowned bodies. Workers quickly fixed the communication network. Other workers gave out aid to people in Sonora.



Atmospheric convection

Atmospheric convection, like other convection, is caused by temperature differences. This may be because the atmosphere is unstable. When parts of the Earth's surface become warmer this can also cause convection. The first type (unstable state of atmosphere) can be called spontaneous. The second type (convection caused by unequal soaking) can be called contact convection. Spontaneous convection starts at any level. Contact convection starts near the surface.

The most frequent is contact convection. The sun is shining on the surface. It gets warmer and warmer. This leads to vertical draft, that is spontaneous rising and downward motions. This warm air has higher temperature than its neighborhood. Warmer air has lower density than cold air. Warm air rises. Through this rising motion the air element decelerates because of friction. This trend stops when the temperature of this element is equal to the temperature of surrounding air. Next rising continues due to inertia

These thermal motions are used for example in gliding. The Thermal flow has enough energy to bring gliders to higher altitude.


COROT-7b

COROT-7b is an exoplanet that orbits the star "COROT-7" in the constellation Monoceros, 489 light years from Earth. 

It was first detected by the French-led COROT mission and reported in 2009. Until the announcement of Kepler-10b in January 2011, it was the smallest exoplanet to have its diameter measured, at 1.58 times that of the Earth which would give it a volume 3.95 times Earth's. It was the first potential extrasolar terrestrial planet to be found. The planet is also notable for its very short orbital period: it revolves around its host star in about 20 hours.

Fullerene

A fullerene is any molecule composed entirely of carbon, in the form of a hollow sphere, ellipsoid, or tube. Spherical fullerenes are also called buckyballs, and they resemble the balls used in association football. Cylindrical ones are called carbon nanotubes or buckytubes. They are usually made in the form of a hollow ball or tube. The fullerene was found in 1985 by Robert Curl, Harold Kroto and Richard Smalley at the University of Sussex and Rice University, and was named after Buckminster Fuller because his famous Geodesic domes are similar in shape.

Fullerenes are made by the heating of graphite in an electric arc in the presence of inert gases such as helium or argon.

The Jesus and Mary Chain

The Jesus and Mary Chain are an alternative rock band formed in East Kilbride, Scotland in 1984. The band is based on the songs written by brothers Jim and William Reid and has had nineteen different musicians over the years. They have created many albums, singles and EPs. The band began playing in 1984 and stopped in 1999. In 2007 the band reunited and began work on a new album with Scarlett Johannson.

The Jesus and Mary Chain was based on the songwriting partnership of its two main members, Jim and William Reid, and bass guitar player Douglas Hart.
The bands first career song, "Upside Down", was sold in October 1984 by Creation Records. The melody and lyrics ("Inside I feel so bad/So low I feel so sad/Feels like I'm going mad/Best friend I've ever had.") are similar to 1960s 'wall of sound' pop music such as music by Brill Building and Phil Spector, but "Upside Down" is more noisy with very simple drums and one guitar playing high pitched feedback during most of the song.

The first drummer to play for the band was Murray Dalglish who was replaced by Bobby Gillespie (now a singer for Primal Scream). William Reid claimed that he had played the drums for the first song himself because of Dalglish's lack of ability. The single was given pleasing reviews by British music journalists, and the band was given fanatical support by the "NME", it was their live shows that started most interest in The Jesus and Mary Chain.

Food additive

A food additive is a substance that is added to certain foods to make them better in some ways. Some additives have been used for centuries, like salting fish or using vinegar to preserve vegetables (called pickling). Another use for additives is to use them for food coloring.


Irish Republican Brotherhood

The Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) were an organisation formed to help make an independent democratic republic in Ireland. They were known as Fenians. They played an important role in the Irish fight for independence from Britain. This helped stage the 1916 Easter Rising.

The IRB was started at the same time in Dublin and in New York in 1858. It was started by a number of men who had been connected with the 1848 rebellion in Ireland. They were a very mysterious organization. They believed the only way to get freedom for Ireland was by using force.

Pablo Casals

Pau Casals i Defilló ("Pablo Casals") (born El Vendrell, Catalonia, 29 December 1876; died San Juan, Puerto Rico, 22 October 1973) was a Spanish Catalan cellist. He made the cello popular as a solo instrument to the younger generation. In his later years he was also a conductor as well as a composer.

Casals made many recordings of solo, chamber, and orchestral music. Perhaps his best known recordings are the ones he made between 1936 and 1939 of the "Cello Suites" by Bach. When the dictator General Franco started to rule Spain he felt very strongly about the political situation. When the democratic party was defeated in 1939 he said that he would never go back to Spain until democracy had been restored. He did not live long enough to see the end to Franco’s rule, which happened two years after his death, with the death of Franco.

Casals' father was the organist at the local church. He gave Casals his first music lessons, teaching him piano, violin and organ. When Casals was eleven, he heard a group of travelling musicians playing music. One of the instruments was the cello. He had never heard one and he decided that was what he wanted to play. His mother took him to Barcelona, where he went to a music school: the "Escola Municipal de Música". There he studied the cello, music theory and piano.

One day, when he was 13, he was looking at some old music in a second-hand music shop. He found some very old music for solo cello. They were the "Cello Suites" by Bach. People in those days thought they were just a collection of studies to help cellists with their technique, but Casals, although only still a boy, realized it was great music. He spent the next 12 years practising them until he felt ready to perform them. Casals’ discovery of these wonderful Cello Suites was the most important Bach discovery since 1829 when Mendelssohn found and performed the St Matthew Passion which the world had forgotten about.

Casals showed enormous talent for the cello. On 23 February 1891, when he was 14 years old, he gave a solo recital in Barcelona. He graduated from the "Escola" with honours two years later.

In 1893, the Spanish composer Isaac Albéniz heard him playing in a trio in a café. He gave him a letter which allowed him to be introduced to the Queen. She gave him money so that he could study at the Conservatory in Madrid. She then allowed him to go to Brussels to study at the Conservatory which was then the best in Europe for string instruments. The cello teacher mentioned a long list of cello pieces and asked him which ones he played. When Casals told him he could play them all, the teacher made fun of him. When Casals started playing, everyone was amazed at his talent. The teacher wanted him to be one of his pupils, but Casals had been insulted and so he went to Paris the next day. The Queen of Spain was angry with Casals when she heard what had happened and stopped sending him money.

In Paris he had very little money. He earned a living by playing second cello in the theatre orchestra of the "Folies Marigny". His mother tried to earn some money by sewing. In 1896, he returned to Catalonia where he taught at a music school and played principal cellist in the orchestra of Barcelona's opera house, the Liceu. In 1897 he appeared as soloist with the Madrid Symphony Orchestra, and was awarded the Order of Charles III from the Queen.

In 1899, Casals played the Saint-Saëns Cello Concerto at Crystal Palace in London, and later for Queen Victoria at her summer home at Cowes, Isle of Wight. He was becoming very famous. In Paris he make a great impression on everyone, especially the conductor Charles Lamoureux who had started a famous orchestra. Casals went to the Netherlands, the United States where he gave 80 concerts, and South America. He often played with the pianist Harold Bauer.
On 15 January 1904 Casals was invited to play at the White House for President Theodore Roosevelt. He played in the Carnegie Hall in New York, playing "Richard Strauss's Don Quixote" with the composer conducting. Between 1906 and 1912 he had a relationship with a Portuguese cellist Guilhermina Suggia, although they were never married.
In 1914 Casals married the American singer Susan Metcalfe. They were separated in 1928, but did not divorce until 1957.

Casals formed a trio with the pianist Alfred Cortot and the violinist Jacques Thibaud. They gave many concerts and made some of the first recordings of piano trio music. They played together for 30 years.

In 1905 he toured Russia. It was an unfortunate time because the Russian Revolution was taking place. During the concert he played in Moscow gunfire could be heard outside the hall.

During the First World War Casals lived in New York. In 1919 he went back to Barcelona. He wanted to improve the music in his own country. There were very few people who could play well, so he founded his own orchestra: the Orquesta Pau Casals. This annual music festival continued until the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936.

Casals supported the Spanish Republican government. When it was defeated he said that he would not return until Spain was once more a democratic country. He then left his country and went into exile. He went to live in the French village of Prades which was near the border with Spain. He continued his career as a cellist. After World War II, in June 1946, he went to England and played the cello concertos by Schumann and Elgar at the Royal Albert Hall with Sir Adrian Boult conducting. Outside the hall the police had to help him get to his car because so many people were crowding round him.

Casals played in many countries, but refused to play in any country that was friendly with Franco’s government in Spain. In 1945 he gave a broadcast at the BBC and spoke to his people in Catalonia. He finished by playing a Catalan folksong called "El Cant dels Ocells" ("The Song of the Birds"). He played it at the end of all his concerts. When Britain recognized Franco’s government, Casals decided he could no long play in England. He made one big exception to his decision not to visit Franco-friendly countries: in 1961 he took part in a concert of chamber music in the White House on 13 November where he played to President John F Kennedy whom he admired.

In 1950 he continued his career as conductor and cellist at the Prades Festival in Conflent. He agreed to play on condition that the money that was made at the festival would be given to a refugee hospital nearby. Franco said that Spaniards were forbidden to go to the festival, but many managed to cross the border on foot. Many world-famous musicians played at Prades: Josef Szigeti, Isaac Stern, Rudolf Serkin and Eugene Istomin and others.

He continued to lead the Prades Festivals until 1966.

When he was 80 Casals married one of his young students, a girl called Marta. They had met in Prades. Marta was from Puerto Rico where Casals’ mother had come from. They went to live in Puerto Rico in a house called "El Pesebre". In 1957 a musical festival was started there in the town of San Juan. He continued to visit the festival at Prades every year until 1966. He also gave masterclasses at American schools and universities as well as in other countries. Some of these were televised.

Casals was also a composer. One of his last compositions was the "Himne a les Nacions Unides" (Hymn of the United Nations); he conducted its first performance in a special concert at the United Nations on 24 October 1971, 2 months before his 95th birthday.

Casals wrote an autobiography "Joys and Sorrows; Reflections" (1970).

Casals died in 1973 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, at the age of 96. In 1979 his remains were taken to El Vendrell, Catalonia, where he had been born. He did not live to see the end of the Franco dictatorial regime. Later, when Franco had died in 1975 and Spain was a democracy once more, the Spanish government under King Juan Carlos I, issued a postage stamp in honour of the centenary of his birth.

In 1989, sixteen years after his death, Casals was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.
No other cellist had such an influence on cello playing in the 20th century. He changed the way people thought about cello technique. For example: when he was young violinists and cellists were taught to practise with a book under the right arm. This made the bowing arm very stiff. Casals taught his pupils to play with a free bowing arm. Casals was a great teacher, and he learned a lot about playing through his teaching. He thought about fingering and bowing, and showed his pupils how their left hand could be strong but also relaxed.

The International Pau Casals Cello Competition is held in Germany once every four years. It was started in 2000 to help young cellists to start their careers. It is supported by the Pau Casals Foundation, under the patronage Casals’ widow. One of the prizes is the use of a beautiful cello which was owned by Casals.

National Football Conference

The National Football Conference (NFC) is one of the two conferences of the National Football League (NFL), the other being the American Football Conference. Every year, the winner of the NFC Championship Game receives the George Halas Trophy and gets to play against the winner of the AFC Championship Game in the Super Bowl.

Each NFC team plays the other teams in their division twice in the regular season. They play the team once at home and once at the other team's stadium (an "away" game). Each team also plays 10 other games given to their schedule by the NFL in the April before. Two of these games are assigned on the basis of the teams' final record from the year before. The other 8 games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions. This assignment shifts each year. For example, in the 2007 regular season, each team in the NFC West played one game against each team in both the AFC North and the NFC South. In this way division competition is the same opponents except for the 2 games given based on the strength of the each team's season record from the year before.

At the end of each season, a series of playoff games are played among the top six teams in the NFC. These are the four division champions (by place standing) and the two other teams ("wild cards") with the best win-loss records. The NFC playoffs culminate in the NFC Championship Game for the George Halas Trophy. The NFC Champion plays the AFC Champion in the Super Bowl.

The NFC was made after the NFL merged with the American Football League (AFL) in 1970. While all of the former AFL teams along with the NFL's Cleveland Browns, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Baltimore Colts made up the American Football Conference (AFC), the other 13 NFL teams formed the NFC.

However, team owners could not agree to a plan on how to put the teams into divisions in the NFC. The proposals were narrowed down to five finalists. Then the plan that was selected was picked out of a glass bowl by then-NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle's secretary.

Since the merger, three expansion teams have joined the NFC. This makes the current total number of teams 16. When the Seattle Seahawks and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers joined the league in 1976, they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC, respectively, for one season before they switched conferences. The Seahawks returned to the NFC as a result of the 2002 realignment. The Carolina Panthers joined the NFC in 1995.

Dalmatian (dog)

The Dalmatian (Croatian: "Dalmatinac") is a breed of dog. It is named after the Adriatic coast of Dalmatia, in Croatia, its first home. The origins of the breed are unknown. The Dalmatian has been used for a war dog, fire department mascot, and shepherd. It is best known, however, as a coach or carriage dog, being a guard for horse-pulled vehicles. Also, the Dalmatian was used for being a circus performer, vermin hunter, fire-apparatus follower, hound dog, and as a guard dog.

There are lots of arguments about the origin of this dog. Spotted dogs are known very much in the history of Africa, Europe, and Asia. Spotted dogs are also thought to have lived in Egypt. In 1700, a dog known as the "Bengal pointer", which looked a bit like the Dalmatian, was popular in England. Some think the Dalmatian is from Croatia, and is a Croatian breed. In the Middle Ages, it was used as a hound dog for hunting. The breed became popular as a carriage dog in the 1800s. They walked among the horses and carriages, following their masters, and guarding the carriages and horses while the master was busy with other things.

The Dalmatian is a medium , strong dog. Its skull is flat on the top. The muzzle is almost the same length as the top of the skull. Its nose can be either black, brown (liver), blue, or a dark gray that looks like black. Its round eyes are either brown or blue, or sometimes both put together.

Its toenails are white or black in dogs with a black spotted coat and brown or white in those with liver colored spots. Puppies are usually born completely white and the spots develop a few weeks after they are born.

The Dalmatian stands .

Around 8% of Dalmatians are born deaf and some can become partially deaf after a while making them expensive to treat.

Dalmatians are known as the "clowns" in the dog world. They are also loyal to their owners and caretakers. Dalmatians are medium sized dogs, and they are very active and lively. They are brave and smart, and their senses are very bright. This makes them a good choice to become a companion dog.

Araucaria heterophylla

Araucaria heterophylla, also called the Norfolk Island Pine, is a conifer tree.
The tree comes from Norfolk Island, a small island in the South Pacific. It is part of the family of trees called Araucaria, which are found in South Pacific, mainly on the island of New Caledonia. It is a very old family of trees. It is listed a vulnerable tree, which means that it is in danger of dying out unless efforts are made to save it.

Captain James Cook was the first Europen to see the trees. He thought they would make good masts for ships. The British government sent people to live on Norfolk Island in 1788 to make sure that these trees would be kept for use by the Royal Navy.

Vulnerable species

A vulnerable species is a species of animals or plants which are threatened with extinction unless something changes. Something has to be done to remove the things that are harmful to their survival, and their rate of reproduction needs to increase.

A vulnerable species is one which has been categorised by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. There are now 4728 animals and 4914 plants listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.

Vulnerable species of mammals include:

Vulnerable species of birds include:

Extinct in the Wild

Extinct in the Wild (EW) is a conservation status given to a species, a group of plants or animals, when the only known living members are being kept in captivity (kept in a zoo or aquarium, or planted in pots), or they are no longer living in their normal habitat. 
Examples of such animals include:


Reintroduction is the release of species back into the wild. They come from captivity or moved from other areas where the species survives. It usually involves species that are endangered or extinct in the wild.

It is very hard to reintroduce EW species into the wild, even if their natural habitats were fixed. The main reason may be that the survival skills, which are passed from parents to offspring during parenting, are lost. In other words, the genetics of the species are saved, but the natural skills of the species are lost.

Roscoe Wind Farm

The Roscoe Wind Farm in Roscoe, Texas, was the world's largest wind farm (back in October 2009) with 627 wind turbines and a total installed capacity of 781.5 MW, which surpassed the nearby 735.5 MW Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center. The project cost more than $1 billion and provides enough power for more than 250,000 average Texan homes. It is located about 200 miles (320 kilometers) west of Fort Worth. The wind farm area spans parts of four Texas counties and covers nearly 100,000 acres, several times the size of Manhattan.

Unlike fossil-fueled power plants, wind farms require no water and generate no carbon dioxide -- a heat-trapping greenhouse gas that is a major contributory component for global warming.

Sherbino Wind Farm

The Sherbino Wind Farm is in Pecos County in west Texas. The first 150 megawatts (MW) of the project, which will be able to create 750 MW, is in operation. Phase I uses 50 Vestas V-90 wind turbine generators, each with a rated capacity of 3 MW. BP will operate phase I of the project. 


Aglaonema

Aglaonema is a genus of about 40 species of foliage plants in the family Araceae, native to the tropical swamps and rainforests of southeastern Asia from Bangladesh east to the Philippines and north to southern China. They are commonly known as "Chinese evergreens".

Swallowing

Swallowing happens when food goes through the mouth of a person or animal into their throat. During swallowing, the food passes through a few organs called the pharynx, esophagus and lastly the stomach.

Overweight

Overweight is the condition of a person when they have more fat in their body than is healthy.

Overweight means the person's body is too heavy. To find out if a person is overweight, you can calculate their body mass index. People with a BMI of 25 or more are overweight. Anything above 30 is obese (very overweight). Overweight used to be a BMI of 27 or more. In 1998 this changed.

Being overweight is associated with health problems such as Type 2 diabetes. Obesity is associated with greater health problems than overweight. In 2006 Adams et al. estimated that the risk of death increases by 20 to 40 percent among overweight people. Some people think that being overweight is not as unhealthy as is commonly thought. A 2013 review of 97 PubMed articles with a sample size of 2.88 million found that overweight is associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality (death) than 'normal' weight. Body fat contains energy that the body can use to heal when it is sick. 
51.3% of overweight adults are metabolically healthy. Metabolically healthy overweight women are no more likely to die or have a heart attack or stroke than metabolically healthy normal weight women.

Doctors often tell overweight people that losing weight would be good for their health. People usually try to lose weight by eating less. This is called 'dieting'. They may exercise too.
Dieting is often ineffective, unless it is done healthily in the long term (avoiding crash diets). 41% of dieters weigh more four to five years after the end of the diet than before it began.

Some people might use herbal teas, powders and pills to help to lower their mass.

Animals can also be overweight.

Overweight is not just associated with bad health. People think that being overweight means that a person is lazy or bad. Overweight people are often treated badly by other people for because of this. This is called fatphobia.

Almost 1.5 billion adults are overweight in the world, with another 400 million obese (in total around 25-30% of adult population). The amount of overweight people is increasing.

National day

National days are the days which are very special and important for a nation. A National day is a special day where people celebrate their country or nation each year. Most countries have national days and they are usually a national holiday, where people don't go to work or school. In many countries which used to be colonies, the national day is known as because it remembers the day they became independent from their old empire. In other countries like China, the national day remembers when the old government of the country changed to the new one. In the past, the king or emperor's birthdays were often treated as a kind of national day. 

Most countries have only one national day each year but some (like India, Bangladesh and Pakistan) have more than one. The different parts of the United Kingdom used to be separate independent nations and still have national days, but the UK does not have one holiday for the whole country apart from the Queen's Official Birthday. (This isn't her real birthday or an official holiday, but a special Saturday to remember her when people are usually already off work anyway.) Denmark is another country that has no official national day.





























Crying

Crying is when tears come out of a person's eyes because of their emotions.

Some animals also cry. However, animals mostly release tears for reasons such as intense pain, and also cry when losing loved ones, seeing their own species being killed for their skin and meat, but these two reasons are mostly rare.

When over 300 adults were asked how often they cried, they found out that men usually cry once every month, and women cry five or more times per month.

According to the German Society of Ophthalmology, which has collected scientific studies on crying, the average woman cries between 30 and 64 times a year, and the average man cries between 6 and 17 times a year.

A useful term is "lachrymation", which means the non-emotional shedding of tears. There are many terms for the more usual crying: sobbing, weeping, wailing, whimpering, bawling, and blubbering.

In general, crying is non-verbal communication. It (and other) facial signals evolved in our species as ways which help people in social groups signal feelings. The term "a cry for help" recognises this function. "Cry for joy" expresses the fact that sometimes great delight can be the trigger for crying.

It holds that both the scripture of the Torah and mouth-to-mouth traditions later written down in the Talmud etc., were actually and literally given by God, and that past rabbis handed them over without change and were always faithful in deciding how they applied to reality. Because of this, Orthodox Judaism is very careful in holding to the tradition of past rabbis, and is very conservative on how current rabbis may decide what the law is in new cases. Orthodox Jews consider themselves as the only truly faithful Jews and reject all the new non-Orthodox forms of Jewish thought, religious or secular, that came to be in the last 250 years (since the Jewish community lost its powers to enforce people, and Jews began to be citizens of the modern state). Even so, they are a product of new times just like everyone else: Their community organizations were created so they could separate from other Jews because those stopped being religious. The Orthodox also had to make very new ways of thinking and acting to deal with the big changes. 

As of 2001, Orthodox Jews and Jews affiliated with an Orthodox synagogue, accounted for approximately 50% of British Jews (150,000), 25% of Israeli Jews (1,500,000) and 13% of American Jews (529,000). (Among those affiliated to a synagogue body, Orthodox Jews represent 70% of British Jewry and 27% of American Jewry).

Its followers must usually promise the following:

Island of the Blue Dolphins

Island of the Blue Dolphins is an American book written for children by Scott O'Dell. It came out in 1960 and that same year won the Newbery Medal (a prize given to books for children). It is based on the true story of Juana Maria, the "Lone Woman of San Nicolas", a Native American woman left alone for 18 years on San Nicolas they live in the himilaya mounatins papapapa . 

O'Dell wrote a sequel to the story called "Zia".

San Nicolas Island

San Nicolas Island is the farthest from shore of California's Channel Islands. It is part of Ventura County. The 14,562 acre (58.93 km² or 22.753 sq mi) island is used by the United States Navy for a weapons testing and training. The only people who live on the island are about 200 people with the military. The island has a small airport and a big billboard.

San Nicolas was once the home of the Nicoleño people, who were probably related to the Tongva of the mainland and Santa Catalina Island. It was named for Saint Nicholas by Spanish sailor Sebastián Vizcaíno after he saw the island on the saint's feast day (December 6) in 1602. Vizcaíno reported that there were a lot of people living on the island. By 1800 the number of people on the island had gone down. In 1811 a group of Kodiak men from Alaska were put on to San Nicholas to hunt otters. They fought with the Nicoleños. When the Kodiaks left there were less than 100 of the original population left. By 1835 the population was about 12. The Nicoleños were taken off the island in the 1835 by the members of the California mission system. Within a few years of leaving the island the Nicoleño all died. 

The most famous person from San Nicolas Island was the "Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island". She was left on the island in 1835 when the rest of the Nicoleños were moved to the missions. She lived on the island alone for 18 years before she was found and brought back to Santa Barbara in 1853. By this time there was no-one left who could speak her language. Her real name was never known, but as she was dying she was named Juana Maria. She died from dysentery seven weeks later. Her story was used for Scott O'Dell's award winning 1961 novel "Island of the Blue Dolphins". Today, a commemorative plaque about her life has been placed on the back of the east bell tower at Mission Santa Barbara. In 2012 scientists rediscovered a buried cave on the island where they believe the woman lived.

From 1957 and 1973, and in 2004, U.S. rockets were launched from San Nicolas Island.

There are few kinds of plants and animals on San Nicolas Island. Sheep ate many of the plants before they were taken away in 1943. Even so, there are several plants that can only be found on the island. Three kinds of animals are there and nowhere else: deer mouse, island fox, and island night lizard. The island also has many birds.


Vladimir Kozlov

Oleg Aleksandrovich Prudius (; , "Oleh Oleksandrovych Prudius"; born April 27, 1969) is an Ukrainian-American actor and professional wrestler. He is currently signed to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) under his real name. Prudius became famous for his work in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) from 2006 to 2011 under his ring name Vladimir Kozlov. He is trained in freestyle wrestling, rugby, American football, sambo, kickboxing, judo, and mixed martial arts.

Prudius has also worked as a stage and screen actor, having a small part in Spike Lee's "25th Hour". He also had a role in "Grindhouse", appearing in the ""Werewolf Women of the SS"" trailer; he was credited under his real name and his WWE persona for the appearance. He is a former Ohio Valley Wrestling Heavyweight Champion.

On December 8, 2009, Prudius became a United States citizen.

Prudius has won numerous achievements, becoming the 2005 USA Open Heavyweight Sambo Champion
and a United States Kick-Boxing Association (USKBA) International Heavyweight Grappling Champion. He has also played American football for the Ukrainian National Team as well as Santa Barbara City College.

Prudius accompanied Jerry Jarrett to the ring at Slammiversary in 2005.

On January 17, 2006, World Wrestling Entertainment announced that Prudius had signed a developmental deal and was sent to Deep South Wrestling. On April 7, 2006 he started wrestling under his real name "Oleg Prudius" and had his first match in DSW against Tommy Suede.

On May 5, 2006, Prudius had his first untelevised WWE match during a house show in San Jose, California, defeating Rob Conway. The next night, at another house show in Sacramento, California, Matt Striker cut a promo on Prudius, calling him a "filthy immigrant," causing Prudius to attack him. Prudius then picked up the microphone and said he that he is "proud to be in America."

On the December 18, 2006 episode of "Raw", Prudius was introduced in an interview as the newest Russian WWE Superstar named Vladimir Kozlov. For the next several weeks, Kozlov was interviewed on WWE TV, saying he loved "Double Double E" (WWE). But he also said he could beat all of the WWE Superstars, becoming a heel.

On July 28, 2007 in Louisville, Kentucky, he won the OVW Heavyweight Championship by defeating Paul Burchill, but gave up the Championship the same night to Michael W. Kruel due to an agreement they made before.

On the April 4, 2008 episode of "SmackDown", Kozlov made his official WWE debut as a heel, with no entrance music and video – his "entrance" was completely dark except for a spotlight following him to the ring. He defeated Matt Bentley in his first match, and over the following weeks, Kozlov would win many matches in a row. On the July 11, 2008 episode of "SmackDown", Kozlov got an entrance theme and video and defeated Stevie Richards.

In the following weeks, as Kozlov continued to easily win matches, he wanted "better competition". On the September 12, 2008 edition of "SmackDown", he attacked Jeff Hardy. Over the following weeks, Kozlov would continue attacking both Hardy and the WWE Champion Triple H, eventually starting a loose rivalry between the three of them over the WWE title. Kozlov earned a match against Triple H for the WWE Championship at Survivor Series by defeating The Undertaker by disqualification on the November 6 episode of "SmackDown". Edge was added to a match right in the middle of it, and pinned Triple H to win the match. This is because Jeff Hardy was originally supposed to compete, but was found unconscious in a Boston stairwell. At Armageddon, Kozlov gained his first pay-per-view win by defeating then-ECW Champion Matt Hardy in a non-title match. Kozlov competed in the 2009 Royal Rumble match, entering at number 6, but was eliminated by Triple Hafter eliminating three other superstars including The Great Khali, MVP, and Carlito. His first singles loss on "SmackDown" came against The Undertaker on March 13.

On April 13, 2009, Kozlov was drafted to the ECW brand as part of the 2009 WWE draft. After the ECW brand ended in 2010, Kozlov made his debut for the "Raw" brand on March 8, in a handicap gauntlet match with John Cena competing against Kozlov, Mr. McMahon, Batista, Mark Henry, Drew McIntyre and Jack Swagger. 
That year, Kozlov formed a tag team with Santino Marella. On the December 6 episode of "Raw", Kozlov and Marella won the WWE Tag Team Championship by defeating the defending champions Heath Slater and Justin Gabriel, Mark Henry and Yoshi Tatsu, and The Usos in a four-way elimination tag team match. They lost the tag team titles back to Slater and Gabriel at Elimination Chamber 2011. On March 8, Kozlov became the pro of Conor O'Brian on "NXT Redemption". Kozlov's last WWE match was on the August 5 episode of "SmackDown", where he lost to Mark Henry. After the match, Henry (kayfabe) broke Kozlov's left leg before Sheamus came down to the ring and saved him from Henry. On the same day, WWE announced that Kozlov was released from his WWE contract.

On October 12, 2023, Prudius returned to Impact Wrestling. He would attack Champagne Singh, Eric Young, and Jake Something to help Dirty Dango win.

Prudius has made many television appearances. He appeared in the second season of the HBO drama series "The Wire", as well as "Roksalana" and "It's Not To Easy" on Ukrainian TV. In 2002, he appeared in Spike Lee's film "25th Hour", playing a Russian mafia enforcer. He appeared in the Russian military theatre play "Victory Day" and a Ukraine University play "Three Musketeers".




Anchises

In Greek mythology, Anchises was a son of Capys and Themiste (daughter of Ilus, son of Tros) or Hieromneme, a naiad. He is famous because he was mortal and a lover of the goddess Aphrodite (and in Roman mythology, the lover of Venus). He was also the father of Aeneas, who is the hero of "The Aeneid."
Anchises, in Greek legend, member of the junior branch of the royal family of Troy: While he was tending his sheep on Mount Ida, the goddess Aphrodite met him and, enamoured of his beauty, bore him Aeneas. For revealing the name of the child’s mother, Anchises was killed or struck blind by lightning. 

Anchises was the son of Capys and Themiste in Greek mythology, father of Aeneas. He was better known as a lover of the goddess Aphrodite, who appeared in front of him disguised as a Phrygian princess. She then seduced him into lovemaking for two weeks. Aphrodite became pregnant with Aeneas, and she appeared in front of Anchises with the newborn, revealing her true identity. She then told him not to boast of their affair to anyone; he did not listen to her, and Zeus hurled a thunderbolt against him, either scorching him or crippling him. He later married Eriopis, with whom he had at least one daughter, Hippodameia. During Troy's fall at the end of the Trojan War, his son Aeneas helped him escape as he was no longer able to walk after Zeus' punishment.

In later legend and in Virgil’s Aeneid, he was conveyed out of Troy on the shoulders of his son Aeneas, whose descendants founded Rome, and he died in Sicily.

Racing

Racing is a kind of competition or contest where winning means doing or finishing something before the other contestants do. 

Usually, a race involves people getting from one place to another. Running is a kind of racing where people try to be the first person to run from the where the race started to the goal or finish line. People also race in cars, boats, airplanes and other vehicles, and on animals like horses. Animals and machines can also race without people riding them. Often they race on a race track.

A race can also involve any other type of goal like eating. An example is a hot dog eating race, where people try to eat more hot dogs than the other contestants. 

Some contests are not races. They could involve contestants trying to get the highest score in a particular quiz. 

Erie Canal

The Erie Canal is a canal in New York State. It runs for 365 miles from the Hudson River to Lake Erie. It connects the Great Lakes with the Atlantic Ocean. The State authorized it in 1808, and it was built between 1818 and 1825. It was the first route between the eastern coast of the United States and the Great Lakes. The Canal caused a burst of population in western New York. It also helped New York City become a large port. Today, the Canal is part of the "New York State Canal System".


Coconut crab

The coconut crab ("Birgus latro") is a large edible land crab related to the hermit crab. Coconut crabs are found in the tropical parts of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Although they are named the Coconut crab, they don't eat coconuts that often. They mainly eat fruits and nuts. Coconut crabs can climb trees. Coconut crab meat has been considered a local delicacy. Coconut crabs are extremely high priced in the national food market. They can live up to 120 years.

The coconut crab is the largest terrestrial arthropod, and indeed terrestrial invertebrate, in the world. There are different reports on its size: most sources give a body length up to , a weight up to , and a leg span more than . Males are generally larger than females. The carapace may reach a length of , and a width up to .

Like with other decapots, the body of the coconut crab is divided into a front section (cephalothorax), which has 10 legs, and an abdomen. The front-most pair of legs has large chelae (claws); the left claw is larger than the right. The next two pairs, as with other hermit crabs, are large, powerful walking legs with pointed tips. This allows coconut crabs to climb vertical or overhanging surfaces. The fourth pair of legs is smaller with tweezer-like chelae at the end: young coconut crabs use it to grip the inside of a shell or coconut husk to carry for protection, adults use this pair for walking and climbing. The last pair of legs is very small and is used by females to tend their eggs, and by the males in mating. This last pair of legs is usually held inside the carapace, in the cavity containing the breathing organs. Some difference in color occurs between the animals found on different islands, ranging from orange-red to purplish blue; in most regions, blue is the predominant color, but in some places, including the Seychelles, most individuals are red.

Although "B. latro" is a derived type of hermit crab, only the juveniles use salvaged snail shells to protect their soft abdomens, and adolescents sometimes use broken coconut shells for that purpose. Unlike other hermit crabs, the adult coconut crabs do not carry shells, but instead harden their abdominal terga by depositing chitin and chalk. Not being constrained by the physical confines of living in a shell allows this species to grow much larger than other hermit crabs in the family Coenobitidae. Like most true crabs, "Blatro" bends its tail underneath its body for protection. The hardened abdomen protects the coconut crab and reduces water loss on land, but must be shed yearly. Adults moult annually, and dig a burrow up to long in which to hide while vulnerable. They remain in the burrow for 3 to 16 weeks, depending on the size of the animal. After shedding, 1 to 3 weeks are needed for the exoskeleton to harden, depending on the animal's size, during which time the animal's body is soft and vulnerable, and it stays hidden for protection.

Plant sap

Plant sap, or just sap, is fluid transported in xylem tubes or phloem cells of a plant. Xylem cells transport water and inorganic nutrients through the plant; phloem cells transport sugary fluids and other biological molecules.

Latex or resin is not plant sap. They are separately produced, with different components and functions.

Xylem sap is mainly water, with plant hormones, mineral elements and other nutrients in a dilute solution. Sap in xylem moves from roots towards the leaves.

Phloem sap is water, with manufactured sugars, other biological molecules and mineral elements dissolved in it. It flows from where carbohydrates are produced or stored to where they are used.

A large number of animals, all of the single insect order Hemiptera, feed directly on phloem sap, and make it the primary component of their diet. Phloem sap is "nutrient-rich compared with many other plant products and generally lacking in toxins and feeding deterrents, [but] it is consumed as the sole diet by a very restricted range of animals". Phloem sap is physiologically extreme in terms of animal digestion: it is thought that few animals take direct advantage of this because they lack adaptations to this diet.

Many more consume phloem sap by proxy, feeding on the honeydew (a sweet secretion) of phloem-feeding hemipterans. Honeydew is physiologically less extreme than phloem sap. Others feed on the biomass of insects which have grown on direct ingestion of phloem sap.

Many products are made from plant sap. One of them is maple syrup. Maple syrup is made using sap from sugar maple trees.

Sap colour is different for different plants.

Threatened species

Threatened species are any species (including animals, plants, and fungi) which may become endangered.

The World Conservation Union (IUCN) are the experts on threatened species. They put threatened species into three groups, each group in more danger than the next: 

One way scientists can work out how threatened a species is, is to measure the birth and death rates. If a species becomes small in numbers, it can get to a critical point. This happens when there are not enough individuals left alive to continue the species (critical depensation).

Species that are not a threatened species, but are still a concern, can be put into groups of Near Threatened, Least Concern, and Conservation Dependent. Conservation dependent is no longer used a group. When the species has not been studied, Not Evaluated, or there is not enough information, Data Deficient, the IUCN does not put them on the threatened species list.

Threatened species are also called "red listed" species, because they are in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Under the Endangered Species Act in the United States, "threatened" means any species which is likely to become endangered in the near future, in all, or a large part of its range. The Bay checkerspot butterfly ("Euphydryas editha bayensis") is an example of a threatened species protected by the Endangered Species Act.

Total Drama Island

Total Drama Island is a Canadian animated television show created by Jennifer Pertsch and Tom McGillis, produced by FreshTV and Cartoon Network Studios and first shown on June 7, 2008 on Cartoon Network. It is shown in Canada on Teletoon. It is the first season of the "Total Drama" series, followed by "Total Drama Action", and "Total Drama World Tour".

The show spoofs many other reality shows, taking on elements of "Survivor", "Fear Factor" and "Iron Chef". Every week, both teams compete in a challenge. The winning team becomes immune to getting kicked off the show (called "invincibility"), while the losing team has to do an internal vote to select who is eliminated. That night, the losing team meets around a campfire, where Chris Mclean, the show's producer, gives each camper a marshmallow. The camper with the least votes for leaving gets the first marshmallow, the camper with the second least votes gets the second marshmallow, and so on, until the camper with the most votes for elimination is left. The camper that got the most votes is eliminated then, and must walk down the ""Dock of Shame"" to the ""Boat of The Losers"".

There are the twenty two participants who get selected for the reality show Total Drama Island:
























Cartoon Network has broadcast the show in many parts of Europe due to the Pan-European feed. Jetix has been broadcasting the show in The Netherlands, and the UK.

1985 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1985 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1985 and ended on November 30, 1985. However storms can form outside these dates for example, Tropical Depression Thirteen formed on December 7. As far as activity goes this was average. This season featured four powerful hurricanes, they include Hurricane Elena, Hurricane Gloria, Hurricane Juan and Hurricane Kate.

In the spring of 1986 the names Elena and Gloria were retired and replaced by Erika and Grace in 1991.

Standartenführer

Standartenführer was a Nazi Party rank that was used in both the S.A. and the S.S.. First started as a rank in 1925, in 1928 the rank became one of the first commissioned Nazi ranks and was given to S.A. and S.S. officers who commanded units known as "Standarten" which were between three hundred and five hundred men.

In 1929 the rank of Standartenführer was split into two ranks known as "Standartenführer (I)" and "Standartenführer (II)". This idea was given up in 1930 when both the S.A. and S.S. grew their rank systems to allow for more ranks.

By the start of World War II, Standartenführer was widely used as both an SS rank and a rank of the S.A.. In the Waffen-SS, the rank was considered the equivalent of an "Oberst" (colonel). 

The insignia for Standartenführer was of a single oak leaf worn on both collars and was the first of the S.S. and S.A. ranks to be worn on both collars. From 1938, newer SS uniforms featured the shoulder boards of a German Oberst as well as the oak leaf collar patches.


Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross

The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (German language: "Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes", often just "Ritterkreuz") was a level of the Iron Cross.

The Junkerschule was a officer candidate school in Bad Tölz that trained men to become full SS officers.

The rank of SS-Junker was split into four levels, those being "Junker", "Oberjunker", "Standartenjunker", and "Standartenoberjunker".

Stamp act

A stamp act is a law that puts a tax on the transfer of some documents. Those that pay the tax get an official stamp on their documents. Many products have been covered by stamp acts such as playing cards, patent medicines, cheques, mortgages, contracts and newspapers. The items often have to be physically stamped at approved government offices following payment of the duty, although other methods with annual payment of a fixed sum or purchase of adhesive stamps are more practical and common. Stamp acts have been made common in many countries, like Australia, China, Canada, Ireland, Malaysia, Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States.

The money raised by the tax, called stamp duty, was first used in the Netherlands in 1624 after a public competition to find a new form of tax. However, it has more been used in Great Britain and its colonies.

The Stamp Act passed by the British Parliament on March 22, 1765 was upsetting to some American colonists. Colonists had to pay a tax on every piece of printed paper they used - ship's papers, legal documents, licences, newspapers and even playing cards were taxed. It was one of the causes of the American Revolutionary War.

Gigantopithecus

Gigantopithecus was the largest ever primate. It lived during the Pleistocene era (1.8 million to 10,000 years ago) when large mammals ruled the Earth. 

"Gigantopithecus" is known to have lived in what is now southern China and Indochina (mainland Southeast Asia). He would have been three meters (10 feet) high if he stood on his hind legs, and probably weighed about 544 kg (1200 lbs). 

In comparison, adult male gorillas stand only 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh about 136 to 195 kg (300 to 430 lbs). The largest recorded was 183 centimeters (6 feet) tall and weighed 267 kg (589 lbs).

Oldman was born in New Cross, London on 21 March 1958. He is the son of housewife Kathleen (née Cheriton; born 28 November 1919), and Leonard Bertram Oldman (21 May 1921 – October 1985), a former sailor who also worked as a welder. Oldman has stated that his father was an alcoholic who left the family when Oldman was 7 years old. Oldman attended West Greenwich School in Deptford, leaving school at the age of 16 to work in a sports shop.

Oldman has earned renown for his classical acting style and diversity, being hailed by famous movie critics such as Roger Ebert and Peter Travers as one of cinema's great actors. Peer Colin Firth described him as "a very strong candidate for the world’s best living actor". An Academy Award nominee, Oldman has won two BAFTA Awards and a Saturn Award, as well as Emmy Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and Palme d'Or nominations.

Oldman's performances during his career have provided inspiration for younger actors who would go on to enjoy successful Hollywood careers: Tom Hardy has described Oldman as his "absolute complete and utter hero", and "hands down, the greatest actor that's ever lived"; Brad Pitt, Daniel Radcliffe, Benedict Cumberbatch and Ryan Gosling have also cited Oldman as their favourite actor. Other actors such as Christian Bale, Shia LaBeouf, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Johnny Depp, Chris Pine, Jason Isaacs and Michael Fassbender have praised Oldman as well.

Oldman married his first wife, Lesley Manville, in 1987 but left her in 1989 three months after their son, Alfie, was born. He met American actress Uma Thurman on the set of "State of Grace", and they were married in 1990, but the marriage ended two years later. Oldman then settled into a relationship with actress and model Isabella Rossellini. The couple were rumoured to be engaged in July 1994 but separated two years later. Oldman was married to Donya Fiorentino from 1997 to 2001 and they have two sons, Gulliver Flynn (b. 20 August 1997) and Charlie John (b. 11 February 1999).

On 31 December 2008, Oldman married English jazz singer Alexandra Edenborough in Santa Barbara, California in a private, formal ceremony. Oldman currently lives in Los Angeles with his family.

Leathermouth

Leathermouth (also spelled as LeATHERMØUTH) is an American hardcore punk band. The band was started in 2007 by My Chemical Romance's guitarist Frank Iero. On January 2009, the band released their first album, "XO".

Leathermouth started in 2007 by some friends of My Chemical Romance's rhythm guitarist Frank Iero. Iero heard a few demo songs from the band, and wanted to sign the band to his own independent label. He later joined the band after the first lead singer did not write any lyrics to the songs. As a member of Leathermouth, this is the first band where he writes the lyrics and does lead vocals. Iero uses the band as a way to express about the way he sees the world and also to let out his personal problems with depression and anxiety. Leathermouth played their first shows in the summer of 2008 alongside Warship for the Fall 2008 Reggie and the Full Effect "Farewell Tour". Iero hopes to tour with Leathermouth when he is not working with My Chemical Romance.

In October 2008, Leathermouth signed to Epitaph Records, rather than to Frank Iero's label as originally planned. Iero thought that it would be hard to advertise the album himself if it was released through his own label, with his current responsibilities to My Chemical Romance and the other bands signed to his label. Epitaph Records president, Brett Gurewitz, was impressed with the band's "intensity and songwriting of the music." Leathermouth released their first studio album, "XO" on January 27, 2009 through Epitaph. Even though the album did not become listed on the Billboard 200, it did reach #21 on the Top Heatseekers chart.

Bakerloo line

The Baker Street & Waterloo line, otherwise known as simply the Baker & Waterloo line or Bakerloo line (), is a line of the London Underground. It is coloured brown on the Tube map. It runs partly on the surface and partly at deep level, from Elephant & Castle in south-east to Wealdstone in north-west of London. The lines serves 25 stations of which 15 are underground. The line is around long.

The line gets its name because it goes through the stations Baker Street tube station and Waterloo tube station. North of Queens Park, the line runs next to the West Coast Main Line.

"Note: For the former Stanmore branch of the Bakerloo line, see the Jubilee line article."

The extension to Camberwell was a plan to extend the Bakerloo Line. The project was to start at the late 1940s, but they cancelled it for an unknown reason. Then in the 21st century, they revised the extension plan and proposed it again. So far, nothing has been agreed. The 1940s version of the extension had two stations. One rumour of why they cancelled the project was because Camberwell was quite a bad location to do further extensions.

Between 1917 and 1982, Bakerloo line trains continued along the DC line past Harrow & Wealdstone to Watford Junction. These stations continue to be served by London Overground.

The Stanmore branch was originally constructed by the Metropolitan Railway (now the Metropolitan line) and was transferred to the Bakerloo line in 1939. It was transferred to the Jubilee line on 1 May 1979. It connected to the main line at Baker Street.

Lemuriformes

Lemuriformes are an infraorder of Primates. It combines the lemurs of Madagascar, with the galagos and lorises of Africa and Asia.

The lorises and lemurs are a monophyletic clade. However, a popular alternative taxonomy puts the lorises in their own infraorder, the Lorisiformes.

Lemuriform origins are unclear and debated. The main problem is a lack of clear transitional fossils.

Molecular clock estimates suggest that lemurs and the lorisoids diverged in Africa during the Paleocene, about 62 mya. Between 47 and 54 mya, lemurs got to Madagascar by rafting. In isolation, the lemurs diversified and filled the niches often filled by monkeys and apes today.

In Africa, the lorises and galagos diverged during the Eocene, about 40 mya. Unlike the lemurs in Madagascar, they have had to compete with monkeys and apes, as well as other mammals.

Because the skeletons of adapiforms share strong similarities with those of lemurs and lorises, researchers have often referred to them as "primitive" strepsirrhines, lemur ancestors, or a sister group to the living strepsirrhines. They are included in Strepsirrhini, and are considered basal members of the clade.

Although their status as true primates is not questioned, their relationship with other primates in Strepsirrhini is unclear. Sometimes they are put in their own infraorder; sometimes they are sometimes reduced to families in the Lemuriformes.

Harrow &amp; Wealdstone station

Harrow & Wealdstone station is a station on the Bakerloo line. The Bakerloo line is on London Underground. The station opened for underground trains in 1917.

The station is served by London Overground, London Midland and Southern. On 8 October 1952, the station was the site of a train crash in which 112 people were killed.

Bus routes 140 (24 hour), 182, 186, 258, 340, H9, H10 and night bus route N18 serve various stops beside or near the station. All the buses that serve the station also serve Harrow on the Hill station but not all as direct services.

German Cross

The German Cross () was begun by Adolf Hitler on 16 November 1941 as an award that was a higher level than the Iron Cross First Class but below the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. It was given in two classes: gold and silver (the color of the laurel wreath around the swastika), the gold was given out for bravery, the silver was given out for excellent service.
This award was also available in cloth, which made for easier wear on the combat uniform.

The title of the award is taken from the fact that the swastika is a type of cross.

The University is organized into twelve undergraduate colleges, two professional schools, seven graduate schools, and an open university and distance learning program, which are all being supervised by the Executive Vice President. 

The twelve undergraduate colleges are the College of Accountancy & Economics, College of Architecture & Urban Planning, College of Engineering & Technology, College of Human Development, College of Liberal Arts, College of Management & Entrepreneurship, College of Mass Communication, College of Nursing, College of Physical Education, Recreation & Sports, College of Physical Therapy, College of Science, and College of Tourism, Hotel & Travel Industry Management. The two professional schools are the College of Law and the College of Medicine. The seven graduate schools include Graduate School of Arts, Sciences & Education, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Graduate School of Engineering, Graduate School of Law, Graduate School of Management, Graduate School of Urban & Settlements Planning, and the President Ramon Magsaysay School of Public Governance. The university's open university and distance learning program is served through the Emeritus College, Open University, and the District Colleges.

PLM is the tenth largest university in Metro Manila with a total student enrollment of 13,711 (as of January 20, 2006). For the undergraduate class of 2011, PLM received 40,000 college applications, and accepted 3% of them.

PLM's endowment in 2008 was valued at PhP 500 million, excluding the funding allotted for its teaching hospital, Ospital ng Maynila Medical Center, of about PhP 250 million. The University spends about four to fives times the national average for education.
PLM utilizes a semester-based modular system for conducting courses, adopts features of the American system (credits), and employs the General Weighted Average system and a 1.00 to 5.00 grading scale, with 1.00 being the highest possible grade for a particular undergraduate course. The calendar used by PLM consists of two regular semesters of about 15 to 16 weeks each, and semestral breaks of about three to four weeks each. The university requires a minimum of twelve units to be considered a full-time student, with the maximum being twenty units.

The late President, Diosdado Macapagal, who himself visited the University, said that PLM is "a unique university because it is the first community-oriented and socially conscious university in the country." He added that, "it gives poor but deserving public high school graduates of the community the means to acquire higher education." Moreover, he recognized PLM's emerging status as "one of the top universities in the country." Her daughter, President, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo said PLM had a "culture of excellence," and commended the university for what she had believed as its "impressive" accomplishments in various fields.

The country's leading newspaper, The Philippine Daily Inquirer, described PLM as a local university with a national character and reputation. US Ambassador Kristie Kenney, in her speech during the 40th Commencement Exercises at the PLM Grandstand, praised PLM for building a "culture of commitment to public service in its students, faculty and alumni." In an article in the Business Mirror , PLM was considered as the "highest symbol of Manila’s public educational system which radiates another form of power and influence." Websites such as Manila Board say that PLM is one of leading and prime public universities in the country today.

On August 13, 2008, Adel A. Tamano, in his column at the "Manila Times" wrote that PLM is "a unique learning institution" and is "essentially an "honors school" where only the students from lower income families with excellent scholastic records are admitted."

PLM is not a perfect institution, and the university had been criticized in the past for the 'reconsideration' cases, wherein some students who failed to meet the university’s standards for retention were readmitted because of their so-called 'backers'. In order to resolve this issue, the city government has insulated the University from political pressure so as not to compromise its status as one of the country's leading educational institutions.[1] [2]

The site of the PLM campus at Intramuros used to be occupied by the Colegio de Manila (also known as Colegio Seminario de San Ignacio), which was founded in 1590 by Fr. Antonio Sedeño, S.J. The Colegio de Manila formally opened in 1595, and was the first school in the Philippines.

Aside from Colegio de Manila, there were other structures that were built in the site. Iglesia de Santa Ana, the first stone church in the Philippines, was built in 1590 and opened in 1596. However, an earthquake destroyed it, and another church was built in honor of St. Ignatius of Loyola in 1626.

In 1601, the Colegio de San José was set up as an annex of Colegio Seminario de San Ignacio. Twenty years later, Pope Gregory XV, through the Archbishop of Manila, authorized the Colegio Seminario de San Ignacio to confer degrees in theology and arts and elevated it into a university. In 1623, Philip IV of Spain confirmed the authorization, making the school both a pontifical and a royal university, and the very first university in the Philippines and in Asia. In 1722, the Colegio de San José was granted "royal patronage".

In 1768, the Jesuits surrendered the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio to the Spanish authorities after their suppression and expulsion from Spain and its territories. Later, the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio was placed under secular administration and converted into a seminary and a liberal arts college. In 1773, Pope Clement XIV formally declared the dissolution of the Society of Jesus. In 1895, the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio merged with the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of the University of Santo Tomas. The Colegio de San José is now the San José Major Seminary at the Ateneo de Manila University.

The buildings of what was the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio were transformed into military headquarters called Cuartel del Rey, which eventually became known as Cuartel de España. José Rizal was placed on trial for sedition here on December 26, 1896.

During the American occupation, part of the barracks was razed, and a gymnasium was built on it. In early 1930s, one of first games of the NCAA was played in the 31st Infantry Quonset Gym. The buildings and the whole premises served as military headquarters for the 31st Infantry of the United States Army until 1941. During World War II, General Douglas McArthur held command post here, but the entire area was later destroyed by the ongoing military conflict.

In early 1960s, the site was rehabilitated by the city government and a building was constructed at General Luna Street to house the students of Manila High School. On April 24, 1965, President Diosdado Macapagal issued Proclamation 392-A, giving to the proposed city university the three-hectare lot being occupied by Manila High School. On February 26, 1967, the new complex along Victoria Street was opened, and the students of Manila High School were transferred there. On July 17, 1967, the first group of PLM scholars began studying on the site where the modern educational system in the Philippines started.

The call to open a university run by the city government of Manila began during the term of Mayor Arsenio H. Lacson when Ordinance No. 4202 was approved by the City councilors on January 13, 1960. The ordinance allotted a total of PhP 1,000,000 for the construction of the university. Mayor Lacson did not however live to see the realization of this project as he died suddenly of heart attack. Vice Mayor Antonio Villegas took over and continued Lacson's plan. He later issued Executive Order No. 7, s-1963 that created the committee that would draw up the plan of founding a university. He sought the help of Congressman Justo R. Albert, representative of the City's fourth congressional district. Congressman Albert then sponsored House Bill No. 8349 at the Philippines' House of Representatives. The Senate version of the bill was authored by Senators Gil Puyat and Camilo Osias. The two bills were eventually combined into one, and it was discussed during the Fourth Session of the Fifth Congress of the Philippines on January 25, 1965. The final bill was later passed by the joint Congress. On June 19, 1965, the final bill with the title - "An Act Authorizing the City of Manila to Establish and Operate the University of the City of Manila and for Other Purposes" - was signed into law by President Diosdado P. Macapacal in a signing ceremony at Malacañang Palace. The law was captioned as Republic Act No. 4196, which now serves as the University Charter.

With an enrollment of 556 students—both men and women—PLM opened for classes on July 17, 1967. All of them were housed under the University College, which offered liberal arts courses. After a year, a Graduate Institute for Teachers was founded, and it was followed by the Institute of Extramural Studies. At the turn of the decade, the school had expanded its offerings to include degree programs leading to specializations in communication, engineering, education, business administration, nursing.

Maple syrup

Maple syrup is a thick kind of syrup made from the sap of maple trees. It is made mostly of a type of sugar called sucrose, and is usually eaten together with waffles and pancakes. Sometimes, maple syrup is used to bake things such as pies, to make candy, or just as a syrup that adds sweetness to food. It is also sometimes used in making lemonade. 
It was used by eastern North America and later by European settlers. Syrups are usually packed when they are hot. The Canadian province of Quebec is by far the largest producer of maple syrup. It produces about three-quarters of the worlds maple syrup. In cold climates, maple trees keep starch in their trunks and root before the winter, but when spring arrives, the starch is converted to sugar/sucrose that rises the sap.

Pasteurella multocida

Pasteurella multocida is a gram-negative, non-motile coccobacillus that is penicillin-sensitive. "Pasteurella multocida" often exists as a commensal in the upper respiratory tracts of many livestock, poultry, and domestic pets, especially cats and dogs.

"Pasteurella multocida" was first found in 1878 in fowl cholera-infected birds. However, it was not isolated until 1880 by Louis Pasteur, the man in whose honor "Pasteurella" is named.

Pantheon

The Pantheon (meaning "Temple of all the gods") is a building in Rome. It was originally built as a temple to the gods of Ancient Rome, and rebuilt about 126 AD during Hadrian's reign. Today, it is not known what gods were included.

The Pantheon is the best preserved of all Roman buildings. Since it was built, it has always been used. The design of the current building is sometimes credited to Trajan's architect Apollodorus of Damascus, but it may also been Emperor Hadrian's architects who designed it. Scholars now agree that it was not Hadrian himself who built it. Since the 7th century, the Pantheon has been used as a Roman Catholic church. The Pantheon is the oldest standing domed structure in Rome. The height to the oculus and the diameter of the interior circle are the same, .

The Pantheon dome is the largest dome made mainly of unreinforced concrete. It does, however, contain other materials. According to the Jutland Archaeological Society investigations, the lower section of the dome is made of concrete with alternating layers of bricks and volcanic ash (tuff). The spaces between the bricks and ash were filled with mortar.

The term "pantheon" is sometimes used for a building where well-known dead people are buried.

Rosarium Uetersen

The Rosarium Uetersen is a rose garden in the city of Uetersen, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.

The Rosarium is the oldest and largest rose garden in Northern Germany. Established in 1929 and originally designed by landscaping architect Berthold Thormählen, Mathias Tantau and Wilhelm Kordes, the rosarium covers at present over seven hectares more than 35,000 roses and 1020 various rose varieties in all gradations of color and aroma nuances presented.

Carbon copy

Carbon Copy is produced when a sheet of carbon paper is placed between two sheets of writing paper. As a pen, pencil, or typerwriter element presses down to write on the first sheet, exactly the same writing appears on the second sheet. The same is true if the two sheets of paper and carbon paper are placed into a typerwriter to generate two copies of a document. People would type "cc" at the bottom of the paper to show where the carbon copy was sent. When people began using email, the carbon copy (cc) shows that the same email is sent to more than one person.

Ardipithecus

Ardipithecus is a very early hominid genus, which lived during the late Neogene.

Two species are known: "A. kadabba", dated to about 5.6 million years ago (late Miocene), and "A. ramidus", which lived about 4.4 million years ago during the early Pliocene. 

Because this genus shares several traits with the African great ape genera ("Pan" and "Gorilla"), some place it on the that branch rather than human branch. 

Most consider it a proto-human because of a likeness in teeth with "Australopithecus". "Ardipithecus" had bipedalism and reduced canines, like the Australopithecines.

Australopithecus anamensis

Australopithecus anamensis is a species of "Australopithecus". The first fossilized specimen of the species, though not recognized as such at the time, was a single arm bone found in Pliocene strata in the Kanapoi region of East Lake Turkana by a Harvard University research team in 1965. The specimen was tentatively assigned at the time to "Australopithecus" and dated about four million years old. Little additional information was uncovered until 1987, when Canadian archaeologist Allan Morton (with Harvard University's Koobi Fora Field School) discovered fragments of a specimen sticking out of a partially eroded hillside east of Allia Bay, near Lake Turkana, Kenya. 

Six years later the London-born Kenyan paleoanthropologist Meave Leakey and archaeologist Alan Walker excavated the Allia Bay site and uncovered several additional fragments of the hominid, including one complete lower jaw bone which closely resembles that of a common chimpanzee ("Pan troglodytes") but whose teeth are much more similar to those of a human. In 1995, Meave Leakey and her associates, taking note of differences between "Australopithecus afarensis" and the new finds, assigned them to a new species, "A. anamensis", deriving its name from the Turkana word anam, meaning "lake".

Australopithecus bahrelghazali

Australopithecus bahrelghazali is a fossil australopithecine which was discovered in 1993 by the paleontologist Michel Brunet. Brunet found the fossil in the Bahr el Ghazal valley near Koro Toro, in Chad, in Africa and named it Abel. Abel was dated using beryllium-based radiometric dating as living about 3.6 million years ago.

Thurgood Marshall

Thurgood Marshall (July 2, 1908 – January 24, 1993) was an American jurist and the first African American to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. Thurgood Marshall, earlier named Thoroughgood Marshall (which he changed in the 2nd or 3rd grade), was born in Baltimore, Maryland. Marshall served on the Court from 1967 to 1991. In 1946 he was awarded the Springarn Medal for all his achievements and hard work for the NAACP. Marshall had been one of the NAACP's top lawyers. He was one of the lawyers who argued "Brown v. Board of Education". He was also Solicitor General of the United States.

Thurgood Marshall attended Frederick Douglass High School in Baltimore, Maryland and was in the class with the brightest students. He graduated a year early in 1925 with a B-grade average, and was in the top three of his class. In 1929, he married Vivian Burey. He went on to attend Lincoln University and graduated in 1930. He applied to the University of Maryland Law School, but was denied admission because he was black. He later joined the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) and became an active member. In 1934, Marshall became director of the NAACP, Legal Defense and for an Educational Fund. He won his first major civil rights case in Maryland in 1935 with the help of Charles Houston. He won 29 of 32 Supreme Court cases. He went on to argue thirty-two cases before the Supreme Court in 1940. Marshall argued in the Smith v. Allwright which disputed the Texan government preventing the rights of black people from voting in 1944. He also fought in the Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka about racial segregation in public schools in 1948, which was one of the biggest cases of the century. In 1954 the Supreme Court ended racial segregation in public schools. This was a rule violation of the 14th Amendment. It made way for integration and was a major victory of the civil rights movement. He then went on to investigate U.S. Army courts-martial in 1950-1951, in Japan and Korea to help African American soldiers. In 1961 John F. Kennedy appointed him to the US Court of Appeals and he won 29 cases before attending the Supreme Court.

He fought for individual rights. He wrote that ""A child born to a black mother in a state like Mississippi….. has the same rights as a white boy born to the wealthiest person the United States. It’s not true, but I challenge anyone to say it is not a goal worth working for.."" Marshall believed that both blacks and whites should have equal rights but it was not happening in the United States. He thought it was right for both rich and poor children to have equal rights. This quote had to do with Thurgood Marshall’s life because he was not rich but his parents and teachers worked hard to help him become a lawyer. He had to memorize the constitution. As a lawyer, he fought to end segregation between blacks and whites.

Thurgood Marshall was against the death penalty because he didn't think that it was necessary. He argued that there is no reason for the people who did something wrong, to go through the death penalty. He says that they should have a less painful punishment by going to prison instead. In 1990, Marshall said a lot of things about the death penalty and why he didn't want it enforced. 

Back in Thurgood Marshall's time, the time of segregation, some thought that if people were more open they would have seen the most important black male of the century. He joined the NAACP and argued in Brown v Board. To this day there is only one other black male in the Supreme Court justice. In his time in the Supreme Court he worked to end segregation and fought for the equal rights for all people. Even though he’s dead, his legacy is still alive.

An elementary school in Seattle, WA was named after him.

Emanuel Feuermann

Emanuel Feuermann (born Kolomyia, Austro-Hungarian Empire, 22 November 1902; died New York City, 25 May 1942) was a famous Austrian cellist who became a naturalized American.

Feuermann's parents were amateur musicians. His father started to teach him the violin, but the young boy wanted to hold it between his legs like a cello, so his father bought him a small cello. In 1909 the family moved to Vienna so that he could learn the cello from the famous Friedrich Buxbaum, the cellist of the Rosé Quartet and principal cellist of the Vienna Philharmonic. Then he studied with Anton Walter at the Music Academy in Vienna. In February 1914, aged twelve, he played in his first concert, performing Joseph Haydn's Cello Concerto in D with the Vienna Philharmonic conducted by Felix Weingartner. 

In 1917, Feuermann went to Leipzig where he studied with Julius Klengel. Klengel thought his young pupil was incredibly talented, but that he did not know much great cello music. Feuermann worked very hard. Klengel was a good teacher for him

In 1919 Friedrich Grützmacher died and Klengel recommended Feuermann should take his job at the Gürzenich Conservatory in Cologne. Although he was very young he got the job which had a very good salary, but he was not given the title of “professor”. 

During the 1920s he gave many concerts all over the world. In 1929 he became professor at the Musikhochschule in Berlin.He played with famous people such as the violinists Carl Flesch, Szymon Goldberg, Joseph Wolfsthal and Jascha Heifetz, the composer and viola player Paul Hindemith and the pianist Artur Rubinstein.

On April 3, 1933, with the rise of Nazism, he lost his job at the Berlin Conservatory because he was Jewish. He moved to London. He toured Japan and the United States where he played the Haydn concerto with the New York Philharmonic conducted by Bruno Walter. Some music critics were not very impressed with his playing. However, a few days later he gave a recital. Nearly all the professional cellists in New York were there because they had heard that Feuermann was an exceptional player. The audience were extremely enthusiastic and even the music critics changed their minds.

In 1935 he married. He moved to Zürich with his wife, but happened to be in Vienna at the time of the Anschluss while his wife and young daughter were still in Zürich. Bronislaw Huberman helped Feuermann and his family escape to Israel in September 1938. At the end of the year they went to the United States and applied for American citizenship.

He taught at the Curtis Institute of Music and gave concerts and made recordings with other great musicians including Artur Schnabel, Bronislaw Huberman and, especially, with the pianist Franz Rupp. 

Feuermann died in 1942 of an infection after a small operation for haemorrhoids.

Feuermann was one of the greatest cellists who ever lived. The cello was not often heard as a solo instrument in those days, but Feuermann and Pablo Casals made people change their minds. Feuermann did not actually practise very much on his own, but when he was making music with other people he worked very hard at all the detail. He loved teaching. He also loved fast cars. His family were very important indeed to him.

Many believe that Feuermann's interpretation of Antonín Dvořák's Cello Concerto and his performance of Johannes Brahms's Double Concerto with Jascha Heifetz are among the best ever.

Isabella of France (1295 – 22 August 1358) was the Queen consort of England as the wife of Edward II of England. She was also Regent of England for her son Edward III of England when he was too young to rule. Until 1325 she was a traditional queen consort. After that time she had one of the worst reputations of any English queen.

She was the daughter of Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre. As the daughter of two monarchs she was destined to be a queen. While France and England had a common culture, political relations between them were tense. To ease this situation Pope Boniface VIII arranged two marriages. This double-alliance was between Edward I of England and Marguerite of France and also the infant Edward II marrying Isabel. In 1299 the marriage between Edward I and Marguerite took place. The marriage between Edward II and Isabella would wait until she was old enough. They were married in 1308 at Boulogne-sur-Mer in France.

At age 12 the young bride was already considered a great beauty. Since his father's death a year earlier, the 24 year old Edward II was now king. But he showed very little interest in Isabella. His first act as king was to recall the exiled Piers Gaveston. One chronicler wrote "He had home his greatest love."

Whatever their relationship was exactly, Edward II regarded Gaveston with great affection. From the beginning of his marriage to Isabella their relationship was not good. Edward had no romantic interest in Isabella. Isabella soon found her husband was not giving her any money. She wrote to her father telling him she was living in poverty. King Philip quickly wrote back demanding Edward provide for his wife and any children they might have. Edward stalled by giving excuses. Meanwhile Isabella discovered that Piers Gaveston had been given many of the jewels her father had given her as part of her dowry. Isabella was furious. Her uncles warned Edward they would not attend their coronation unless he got rid of Gaveston. But Edward's barons had already made the same threats. Edward promised he would take care of everything when the parliament met in March. When Gaveston was put in charge of the coronation, one thing after another went wrong. At the banquet table honoring the king and queen, Gaveston sat next to the king instead of Isabella. He even displayed his Coat of arms next to the king's instead of Isabella's. The barons and Isabella's kinsmen were angry over these insults to their new queen. But it wasn't until 1311 that the barons drew up a list of ordinances the king had to follow. The first was to get rid of Piers Gaveston. But before 1312 Gaveston came back to England. That same year Isabella was pregnant with their first child. To escape the barons, Edward and Gaveston fled north taking Isabella with them. They left her unprotected at York while Edward and Gaveston escaped on a ship. But the barons were not upset with Isabella. Gaveston was captured and murdered in the summer of 1312. This didn't end Isabella's troubles as Edward found a new favorite in Hugh le Despenser. In November their first child was born, the future Edward III of England. But Despenser hated Isabella more than Gaveston. By 1321 she was virtually a prisoner. By 1324 Edward had given all her lands to Despenser.

In 1325 Edward convinced Isabella to go to France. Her brother Charles IV of France was now king. Edward wanted her to negotiate for him over Gascony. This was Isabella's chance for freedom. She even convinced her husband to send their son Edward (III) to join her. Edward soon realized his mistake and demanded she and his son return. Isabella ignored his demands and remained in France. The anger she must have felt over the years of mistreatment in England finally gave her a chance to rebel against her husband. She had their son, the future king of England with her and Edward could do nothing. At this time she was joined by Roger Mortimer an English exile. Another who came to her aid was Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent, Edward II's half-brother. A number of Englishmen in France joined her cause. Many were upset with Edward II and the Despensers. 

But Isabella was short of funds. She and her followers went north to Hainaut to find more support. In turn for their support, she negotiated a marriage for her son Edward to Philippa of Hainaut. She also gave up any claims she had to the French crown. She now had an army from Hainaut with many Englishmen backing her. While living in Hainaut, she and Roger Mortimer had become lovers.

In 1326 Isabella and her army landed at Suffolk. Neither Edward or the Despensers could mount an army against her. Edward II was captured and lost his throne. His son Edward III was made king in his place, with his mother as regent. 

In 1321 when she was denied access to the Leeds Castle, she made her escort try to force their way in through the gate, and after they failed, she made 13 of her escort hang immediately. She had 4 children and at least 3 miscarriages. When she later died she was buried in her wedding dress.

Orrorin tugenensis

Orrorin is considered to be the second-oldest known hominin ancestor that is possibly related to modern humans. Only one species is known: Orrorin tugenensis. The name was given by the discoverers who found "Orrorin" fossils in the Tugen Hills of Kenya. The fossils were found were estimated to date between 6.1 and 5.8 million years ago, during the late Miocene.

Battle of France

In World War II, the Battle of France, also called the Fall of France, was the German invasion of France and the Low Countries from 10 May 1940 that ended the Phoney War. The battle was made up of two parts.

In the first part, called "Fall Gelb" in German ("Case Yellow" in English), German tank units pushed through the Ardennes to circle the Allied units that moved into Belgium. Most of the British Expeditionary Force and many French soldiers escaped to England from Dunkirk during Operation Dynamo.

The second part of the battle, called "Fall Rot" in German ("Case Red" in English), started on 5 June, when German armed forces circled the Maginot Line to attack the rest of France. Italy got into the war and started its own invasion of France, in the southeast of the country, on 10 June. The French government left Paris for Bordeaux, and the Germans took Paris on 14 June. After the French Second Army Group's surrender on 22 June, France signed an armistice on 25 June.

The campaign was a major victory for the Axis Powers.

The French Third Republic ended. France was split into a German-occupied part in the north and west, a small Italian-occupied part in the southeast, and a satellite state part in the south that was called Vichy France. Southern France was invaded by Germany on 10 November 1942.

France began to be freed by the Allies at the Battle of Normandy in 1944. The Low Countries were freed later in 1944 and in 1945.



Industry

In economics, different kinds of manufacturing and services are broken down into groups called industries. The word comes from a Latin word meaning "working diligently at a task". There are many different industries, like mining, farming and logging. The industrial revolution made new industries.

An industry produces goods or services which are of a common set of qualities and which are indistinguishable (called homogeneous, in economics). It uses standardised processes for production, mass production and divison of labor.

Slavery, which is forcing people to make goods and services, has happened since ancient times throughout the world as a way to have low-cost production. It usually produces goods for which profit depends on economies of scale. International law has declared slavery illegal.

The industrial revolution (from the mid-18th century to the mid-19th century) saw the development and popularization of using machines to make goods instead of using hands. The industrial revolution played a role in the abolition of slavery in Europe and in North America.

Christian Cage

Christopher Jason "Jay" Reso (born November 30, 1973) is a Canadian professional wrestler and actor. He is currently working for All Elite Wrestling (AEW) under the ring name Christian Cage. He is the current AEW TNT Champion and is in his second reign as champion.

Reso became famous under the ring name Christian in the World Wrestling Federation/WWE, where was a former World Heavyweight Champion, two time ECW Champion, four-time Intercontinental Champion and nine-time World Tag Team Champion (seven of those teaming with his real-life friend Edge). He is also known for his time in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as Christian Cage from 2005 to 2008, where he won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship twice during his time in TNA (making him a five-time world champion overall), and was the last official holder of that title under the TNA name. Reso also hosted a weekly podcast with Adam "Edge" Copeland known as “"E&C’s Pod of Awesomeness”". It ran from March 2017 until September 27, 2019.

On March 7, 2021 at Revolution, Cage made his surprise debut for All Elite Wrestling (AEW). It was announced by AEW president Tony Khan in the post-event media scrum that Cage had signed a multi-year contract with the company.

He made his in-ring debut for AEW at Double or Nothing on May 30. He competed in the Casino Battle Royale, lasting until the end before being eliminated by Jungle Boy.

On the September 23 episode of "Collision", Cage won the AEW TNT Championship after competing in a three-way match against Luchasaurus and Darby Allin. Cage had claimed Luchasaurus' TNT Championship as his own in the months leading up to the match. At Worlds End, Cage would lose the title to his former friend Adam Copeland in an no disqualification match. Minutes after the match, Cage would use the title shot that was earned by Killswitch (previously Luchasaurus) earlier on the preshow and win his second TNT Championship.

Pandora

In Greek mythology, Pandora was the first mortal woman. According to Hesiod, each god helped create her by giving her unique gifts. Zeus ordered Hephaestus to mould her out of Earth. This was part of the punishment of mankind, because Prometheus had stolen the secret of fire. Another name for her was Anesidora, she who sends gifts. This name was found inscribed against her figure on a white-ground "kylix" in the British Museum.

According to the myth, Pandora opened a jar ("pithos") and released all the evils of mankind. Apart from plagues and diseases, Hesiod does not specify the evils in detail. When Pandora closed the jar again, only Hope was left inside. The word pithos has been translated the wrong way, which may have led to the idea of "Pandora's box". Pandora opened the jar because she was curious what was inside, and not because of malice.

The myth of Pandora is ancient, and there are several different Greek versions. It has been interpreted in different ways. In the literary versions, the myth is a kind of theodicy, it addresses the question why there is evil in the world. 

The oldest version is that of Hesiod, who wrote it in the 7th century BC. He mentions it in his Theogony, in line 570, but does not name Pandora. 

The Pandora myth first appears in lines 560–612 of Hesiod's poem the "Theogony". This version does not give the woman a name. Prometheus has stolen the gift of fire, and has given it to the humans. Zeus is angry about this and decides to punish men, as a compensation for the gift. He commands Hephaestus to make the first woman from earth. This woman is described as a "beautiful evil" whose descendants would torment the race of men. After Hephaestus does so, Athena dressed her in a silvery gown, an embroidered veil, garlands and a crown of gold. This woman is unnamed in the "Theogony", but is probably Pandora. Hesiod rewrote her myth in "Works and Days". When she first appears before gods and mortals, "wonder seized them" as they looked upon her. But she was "sheer guile, not to be withstood by men." Hesiod elaborates (590–93):

<poem>
From her is the race of women and female kind:
of her is the deadly race and tribe of women who
live amongst mortal men to their great trouble,
no helpmates in hateful poverty, but only in wealth.</poem>

Later, Hesiod tells that men who try to avoid the evil of women by avoiding marriage will fare no better (604–7):
<poem>
He reaches deadly old age without anyone to tend his years,
and though he at least has no lack of livelihood while he lives,
yet, when he is dead, his kinsfolk divide his possessions amongst them.</poem>

At the end, Hesiod says that occasionally a man finds a good wife, but still (609) "evil contends with good."

In his Works and Days Hesiod gives the oldest known literary version of the story. There is an older story that says that urns and jars can contain blessings and evils which is told in Homer's Illiad:The immortals know no care, yet the lot they spin for man is full of sorrow; on the floor of Zeus' palace there stand two urns, the one filled with evil gifts, and the other with good ones. He for whom Zeus the lord of thunder mixes the gifts he sends, will meet now with good and now with evil fortune; but he to whom Zeus sends none but evil gifts will be pointed at by the finger of scorn, the hand of famine will pursue him to the ends of the world, and he will go up and down the face of the earth, respected neither by gods nor men.The more famous version of the myth comes from another of Hesiod's works, called "Works and Days". There, the myth is contained in lines 60 to 105. Hesiod tells about Pandora's origin. He also makes the scope of the misery she inflicts on mankind bigger. As before, she is created by Hephaestus, but now more gods help completing her (lines 63-82): Athena taught her needlework and weaving (63–4); Aphrodite "shed grace upon her head and cruel longing and cares that weary the limbs" (65–6); Hermes gave her "a shameful mind and deceitful nature" (67–8); Hermes also gave her the power of speech, putting in her "lies and crafty words" (77–80) ; Athena then clothed her (72); next she, Persuasion and the Charites adorned her with necklaces and other finery (72–4); the Horae adorned her with a garland crown (75). Finally, Hermes gives this woman a name: Pandora – "All-gifted" – "because all the Olympians gave her a gift" (81). The story is written in such a way that Pandora's feminine and deceitful nature is a small problem for mankind, because she brings a "pithos". This word is usually translated as jar, sometimes as a "box". The box contains "burdensome toil and sickness that brings death to men" (91–2), diseases (102) and "a myriad other pains" (100).

Prometheus had warned his brother Epimetheus not to accept any gifts from Zeus. But Epimetheus did not listen; he accepted Pandora, who promptly scattered the contents of her jar. As a result, Hesiod tells us, "the earth and sea are full of evils" (101). One item, however, did not escape the jar (96–9), hope:
<poem>
Only Hope was left within her unbreakable house,
she remained under the lip of the jar, and did not
fly away. Before [she could], Pandora replaced the
lid of the jar. This was the will of aegis-bearing
Zeus the Cloudgatherer.</poem>

He does not tell the reader why hope remained in the jar.

Hesiod closes with this moral (105): "Thus it is not possible to escape the mind of Zeus."

Archaic and Classic Greek literature do not mention Pandora any more. Sophocles wrote a satyr play "Pandora, or The Hammerers", but very little is known of this play. Sappho may have made reference to Pandora in a surviving fragment.

Later, people filled in small details, or they added postscripts to Hesiod's story. Examples for this are Apollodorus and Hyginus: Each of them added a part to the story, that might have already been in Hesiod's version, even though it was not written down: Epimetheus married Pandora. They each add that they had a daughter, Pyrrha, who married Deucalion and survived the deluge with him. The problem of that version is that Hesiod's Catalogue of Women", fragment #2, had made a "Pandora" one of the "daughters" of Deucalion, and the mother of Graecus by Zeus."

In the 15th century, a monk named Annio da Viterbo said he had found a manuscript of a historian named Berossus. Berossus had lived in the 3rd century BC. According to the manuscript, "Pandora" was also named as a daughter-in-law of Noah. This attempt to join pagan and Christian texts was later recognised as a forgery, though.

The poet Theognis of Megara, who lived in the 6th year BC, had a different point of view:
<poem>
Hope is the only good god remaining among mankind;
the others have left and gone to Olympus.
Trust, a mighty god has gone, Restraint has gone from men,
and the Graces, my friend, have abandoned the earth.
Men’s judicial oaths are no longer to be trusted, nor does anyone
revere the immortal gods; the race of pious men has perished and
men no longer recognize the rules of conduct or acts of piety.</poem>

Theogonis seems to be referring to a different version of the myth: In that version, the jar contained blessings rather than evils. This version seems to follow a tradition before Hesiod, which was preserved by 2nd century writer Babrius. According to Babrius, the gods sent a jar containing blessings to humans. A "foolish man" (not Pandora) opened the jar, and most of the blessings were lost forever. Only hope remained, "to promise each of us the good things that fled."

Attic red-figure painters seem to have had a tradition which was independent of the literary sources: Sometimes, they add to the literary version, sometimes they ignore it altogether.

There are many ways in which the figure of Pandora can be interpreted. Erwin Panofsky wrote a monography on the subject. According to M. L. West, the story of Pandora and the jar is older than Hesiod's versions. This also explains the confusion and problems of Hesiod's version and that it is inconclusive. According to West, Pandora was married to Prometheus in these versions. West cites Hesiod's "Catalogue of Women", which preserved the older version. In one version of the story, the jar may have contained only good things for mankind. West also writes that it may have been that Epimetheus and Pandora and their roles were changed over in the pre-Hesiodic myths. This is called a "mythic inversion". He remarks that there is a curious correlation between Pandora being made out of earth in Hesiod's story, to what is in Apollodorus that Prometheus created man from water and earth. Hesiod's myth of Pandora's jar, then, could be an summary of many different early myths.

There are different questions that need to be discussed. The Greek original text speaks about "elpis". Usually, this word is translated into English as "Hope", but it could be translated differently. "Expectation" is another possible translation, which is more neutral. One can expect good things, as well as bad things. Hope has a positive connotation.

"Elpis" is everything that remains in the jar, when Pandora closed it again, so does the jar give "elpis" to mankind, or does it keep elpis away from it? -Another question to ask is whether elpis remaining in the jar a good thing, or a bad one, for mankind?

The first question might confuse the non-specialist. But as with most ancient Greek words, "elpis" can be translated a number of ways. A number of scholars prefer the neutral translation of "expectation." But expectation of what? Classical authors use the word "elpis" to mean "expectation of bad," as well as "expectation of good." Statistical analysis demonstrates that the latter sense appears five times more than the former in all of ancient Greek literature. Others hold the minority view that "elpis" should be rendered, "expectation of evil" ("vel sim").

How one answers the first question largely depends on the answer to the second question: should we interpret the jar to function as a prison, or a pantry? The jar certainly serves as a prison for the evils that Pandora released – they only affect mankind once outside the jar. Some have argued that logic dictates, therefore, that the jar acts as a prison for "Elpis" as well, withholding it from men. If one takes "elpis" to mean expectant hope, then the myth's tone is pessimistic: All the evils in the world were scattered from Pandora's jar, while the one potentially mitigating force, Hope, remains locked securely inside.

This interpretation raises yet another question, complicating the debate: are we to take Hope in an absolute sense, or in a narrow sense where we understand Hope to mean hope only as it pertains to the evils released from the jar? If Hope is imprisoned in the jar, does this mean that human existence is utterly hopeless? This is the most pessimistic reading possible for the myth. A less pessimistic interpretation (still pessimistic, to be sure) understands the myth to say: countless evils fled Pandora's jar and plague human existence; the hope that we might be able to master these evils remains imprisoned inside the jar. Life is not hopeless, but each of us is hopelessly human.

It is also argued that hope was simply one of the evils in the jar, the false kind of hope, and was no good for mankind, since, later in the poem, Hesiod writes that hope is empty (498) and no good (500) and makes mankind lazy by taking away his industriousness, making him prone to evil.

In "Human, All Too Human", philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche argued that "Zeus did not want man to throw his life away, no matter how much the other evils might torment him, but rather to go on letting himself be tormented anew. To that end, he gives man hope. In truth, it is the most evil of evils because it prolongs man's torment."

An objection to the "hope is good/the jar is a prison" interpretation counters that, if the jar is full of evils, then what is expectant hope – a blessing – doing among them? This objection leads some to render "elpis" as the expectation of evil, which would make the myth's tone somewhat optimistic: although humankind is troubled by all the evils in the world, at least we are spared the continual expectation of evil, which would make life unbearable.

The optimistic reading of the myth is expressed by M. L. West. "Elpis" takes the more common meaning of expectant hope. And while the jar served as a prison for the evils that escaped, it thereafter serves as a residence for Hope. West explains, "It would be absurd to represent either the presence of ills by their confinement in a jar or the presence of hope by its escape from one." Hope is thus preserved as a benefit for humans.

Pandora means "all-giving", but not "all-gifted." Some paintings in vases, from the fifth century before Christ, indicate that the beliefs about the goddess Pandora lasted after the time of Hesiod. Another name of Pandora was found in a kylix (circa 460 BC), "Anesidora", that means "she who sends up gifts." This vase painting depicts Hephaestus and Athenae finishing the touches on the first woman, like in the "Theogony". The epithet "anesidora" is also used to name Gaia or Demeter.

Pandora/Anesidora possibly would have taken on aspects of Gaea and Demeter. Pandora would incarnate the fertility of the Earth and its capacity to bear grain and fruits for the benefit of the Humans. Over time this "all-giving" goddess somehow devolved into an "all-gifted" mortal woman. T. A. Sinclair, commenting on "Works and Days" argues that Hesiod shows no awareness of the mythology of such a divine "giver". A.H. Smith, however, notes that in Hesiod's account Athena and the Seasons brought wreaths of grass and spring flowers to Pandora, indicating that Hesiod was conscious of Pandora's original "all-giving" function. Jane Ellen Harrison sees in Hesiod's story "evidence of a shift from matriarchy to patriarchy in Greek culture. As the life-bringing goddess Pandora is eclipsed, the death-bringing human Pandora arises." Thus Harrison concludes "in the patriarchal mythology of Hesiod her great figure is strangely changed and diminished. She is no longer Earth-Born, but the creature, the handiwork of Olympian Zeus." (Harrison 1922:284) Robert Graves, quoting Harrison, asserts of the Hesiodic episode that "Pandora is not a genuine myth, but an anti-feminist fable, probably of his own invention." H.J.Rose wrote that the myth of Pandora is decidedly more illiberal than that of epic in that it makes Pandora the origin of all of Man's woes with her being the exemplification of the bad wife.

The Hesiodic myth did not, however, completely obliterate the memory of the all-giving goddess Pandora. A scholium to line 971 of Aristophanes' "The Birds" mentions a cult "to Pandora, the earth, because she bestows all things necessary for life".

In fifth-century Athens Pandora made a prominent appearance in what, at first, appears an unexpected context, in a marble relief or bronze appliqués as a frieze along the base of the "Athena Parthenos" the culminating experience on the Acropolis; there Jeffrey M. Hurwit has interpreted her presence as an "anti-Athena" reinforcing civic ideologies of patriarchy and the "highly gendered social and political realities of fifth-century Athens." Interpretation has never come easy: Pausanias (i.24.7) merely noted the subject and moved on. Jeffrey Hurwit has argued that Pandora represents an "anti-Athena", similarly a child of no mother, an embodiment of the need for the patriarchal rule that the virginal Athena, rising above her sex, defended.

The humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam translated Hesiod from Greek to Latin, in the 16th century. The Greek word "pithos" is used for a large jar, used for example for storing wine. It can also refer to a funerary jar. "Pyxis", on the other hand, is a box. Usually, it is said that Erasmus swapped the words when he translated, so Pandora's "jar" became Pandora's box. The phrase "Pandora's box" has endured ever since.


Corpus callosum

The corpus callosum is part of the brain in humans and other eutherian mammals. It is the largest connective pathway in the brain. Its over 200 million nerve fibers connect the left and right hemispheres of the brain. 

The corpus callosum relates to the lateralization of brain function. Because the two side of the brain communicate so intensively, they can afford to specialise in doing somewhat different things.

The corpus callosum is found only in placental mammals (the eutherians). It is absent in monotremes and marsupials, and other vertebrates such as birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish. 

Other groups do have brain structures that allow for communication between the two hemispheres. The anterior commissure serves as the main cross-hemisphere communication in marsupials. 

The fibrous bundle of the corpus callosum increases to such an extent in humans that it wedges apart the hippocampal structures.

Victor Cristaldo is a former Australian Football (soccer) player of the 1980s and 1990s. He played for the Melbourne Knights in Australia. He also played for the Paraguayan teams Sport Colombia and Presidente Hayes.

Paranthropus boisei

Paranthropus boisei was originally called Zinjanthropus boisei and then Australopithecus boisei until recently. It was an australopithecine, the largest of the "Paranthropus" species. It lived from about 2.6 until about 1.2 million years ago during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs in Eastern Africa. It was 4' 6" tall for a male and 4' 1" for a female.

Paranthropus aethiopicus

Paranthropus aethiopicus is an extinct species of hominid. The fossil was discovered in 1985 in Lake Turkana, Kenya. KNM WT 17000 is known as the "Black Skull" due to the dark colouration of the bone, caused by high levels of manganese. It is one of the earliest examples of robust australopithecines from the Pliocene. The skull is dated to 2.5 million years ago, before the other forms of robust australopithecines. 

Curry tree

The curry tree ("Murraya koenigii"), also known as karivepaku, karibevu, karivepallai, karivembu, or kadipatta, is a kind of tree. It is found mostly in hot climates, and is a native plant of India. The leaves of the curry tree are called curry leaves or sweet Neem leaves.

Usually, curry trees grow to 4-6 metres tall, and their trunk grows to 40 centimetres in diameter. Small black, shiny berries that grow on the tree can be eaten, but their seeds are poisonous.

The scientific name of the curry tree, "Murraya koenegii", was chosen to celebrate the botanist Johann Gerhard König, who worked for a long time in India.

Native (ecology)

A species is called indigenous or native to a place when that species lives there because of the natural environment, not human change. A species is an indigen if it lives in the wild and has not had artificial selection by humans. 

If a species is in a place because it was moved by humans, the species is not indigenous to that place. It is an introduced species.


Quicksand

Quicksand is a mixture of water and sand or silt. It has the characteristic of thixotropy: it looks solid, but when pressure is applied it liquifies (acts like a liquid). If animals or people stand on it, they sink into it. However, a person does not drown in quicksand. A human or animal does not sink entirely into quicksand due to the higher density of the fluid. It can be difficult to get out: that is the real problem. Quicksand may be escaped by slow movement of the legs in order to reduce viscosity of the fluid, and rotating the body so as to float on one's back (supine).

Water circulation underground can focus in an area with just the right mixture of fine sands and other materials such as clay. The water moves up and then down slowly in a convection-like manner throughout a column of sand, and the sand remains a generally solid mass. This lubricates the sand particles and makes them unable to support any significant weight, since they move around with very little friction. They behave more like a liquid when exposed to stress. Since the water does not usually go all the way up through the sand, the sand above does not appear to move at all, and can support leaves and other small debris. This makes it difficult to distinguish quicksand from the surrounding environment. 

Quicksand is a non-Newtonian fluid: when undisturbed it often seems to be solid ("gel" form), but a small (less than 1%) change in the stress on the quicksand causes it to turn liquid ("sol" form). There is a sudden decrease in its viscosity. Under his weight, the person then sinks into the sol (liquidised sand).
Someone stepping in it starts to sink. Around the person dense regions of sand and sediment form and grip the person. The viscosity of the quicksand seems to increase suddenly. It is now a gel. In order to move within the quicksand, a person or object must apply sufficient pressure on the compacted sand to re-introduce enough water to liquify it. The forces required to do this are quite large: to remove a foot from quicksand at a speed of one centimeter per second would require the same amount of force as "that needed to lift a medium-sized car".

It was commonly believed that the behavior of quicksand was due solely to saturated or supersaturated suspensions of granules in water. Pressure from underground sources of water would separate and suspend the granular particles, reducing the friction between them. In 2005 it was been shown that the presence of salt is important. The stability of the colloidal quicksand is changed by the presence of salt. It increases the high viscosity regions of sediment responsible for quicksand's "trapping" power. Another finding was that a human cannot be drawn into a saltwater quicksand entirely.

Quicksand may be found inland (on riverbanks, near lakes, or in marshes), or near the coast.

One region notorious for its quicksands is Morecambe Bay, Yorkshire. As the bay is very broad and shallow, a person trapped by the quicksand would be exposed to the danger of the returning tide, which can come in rapidly.


Military organization

A military organization is a way of making up the armed forces of a state as a need to offer military capability as needed by a national defence policy. In some countries paramilitary forces are included in a nation's armed forces. Armed forces that are not a part of the military or paramilitary organizations, such as insurgent forces, often mimic military organizations, or use ad hoc structures.

SS-Verfügungstruppe

The SS-Verfügungstruppe (The Combat Support Force) (short: SS-VT) were combat divisions of the SS, trained to the same way as the normal German Armed Forces (Wehrmacht). They were the precursor of the later-developed Waffen-SS.

On 24 September 1934, a special SS military unit was made up by a group of a few other Nazi and paramilitary units like units known as SS Special Detachments (SS-Sonderkommandos) and the Headquarters Guard known as the (SS-Stabswache) units. The new group was to be trained as combat ready infantry. The unit was called SS-Special Purpose Troops (SS-Verfügungstruppe) and was not the police or the Armed Forces but military trained men for the use by the Führer in war or peace. The SS-Verfügungstruppe (known as SS-VT) was told to the public on 16 March 1935. The SS-VT trained with Hitler’s body guards some of which later joined the SS-VT prior to the invasion of Russia in 1941

Some units of the SS-VT worked with the Wehrmacht during the take over of the Sudetenland, Austria, and Czechoslovakia, and took part in the invasion of Poland along with the campaign against the Allies in the West. From the regiments that made up the SS-VT came the Waffen-SS (or "Armed"-SS) Divisions that fought in all German theaters in World War II. Units making up the SS-VT were not known as the "Waffen-SS" until a speech by Adolf Hitler in July 1940.

In 1939 the whole SS was split into two groups: the Allgemeine-SS (the General SS) and the Waffen-SS (the Armed SS).

The Waffen-SS was made up of three smaller groups

In 1941 the commander of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, said that more Waffen-SS Verfügungstruppe units would be made from non-German foreign nationals. The goal was to get more soldiers from occupied nations. Some of these foreign units included volunteers from Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Norway, and the Netherlands.

Countries like Spain, officially a neutral state, had by the end of the war given many volunteers to the Waffen SS (most of them with the SS Wallonien division) that took part in combat until the end of the European war in Berlin. This and many other volunteers of non-German background were believers in the German cause.


Detachment (military)

A detachment (from the French word "détachement") is a military unit. It can be broken off from a bigger unit for a set reason or (as often seen in United States Army usage) can be a permanent unit smaller than a battalion. The term is often used to refer to a unit that is sent to a different base from the parent unit. 

A Cadet detachment usually consists of between 10 and 40 cadets. Several detachments make up a cadet company.

Battalion

A Battalion is a Military Unit. It is composed of around 500-1500 men. It is often made up of two to seven companies and is under the command of a Lieutenant Colonel or another officer. More than one Battalion often makes up a regiment or a brigade. In the United States Army,Battalions are made up of a Headquarters Company (Or Headquarters Troops for Cavalry Squadrons and Headquarters Batteries for Artillery Battalions) and several support Companies (Or Support Troops/Support Batteries). In a United States Marine Corps Battalion there is a Headquarters and Service Company and several Support Companies assigned to it. There are several types of Battalions in the United States Army. They include Intelligence Battalions,Engineer Battalions,Artillery Battalions,Aviation Battalions,Etc.

A Battalion is often the smallest military unit able to do movement on their own without being part of a larger unit. The battalion is often part of a regiment,group or a brigade. 

Depending on the Region and Country/Service in which the Battalion is assigned to,there are several important people in a Battalion Headquarters and they include the following:


1984 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1984 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1984 and ended on November 30, 1984. Sometimes storms form outside these dates for example. An example of this is Hurricane Lili, which formed on December 12. Lili lasted until December 24.

This season was active, with 17 depression, 13 of them became a tropical storm, 5 of the tropical storms became hurricanes, and 1 of the hurricanes became a major hurricane. Most of the cyclones were weak. The only very damaging storm was Hurricane Diana. Diana was the major hurricane of the season, and the only storm to affect land as a hurricane. 


Kenyanthropus platyops

Kenyanthropus platyops is an extinct hominid species discovered in Lake Turkana, Kenya in 1999. It was by Justus Erus, who was part of Meave Leakey's team. 

The fossil is 3.5 to 3.2 million years old. It has a broad flat face with a toe bone that suggests it probably walked upright. Teeth are intermediate between typical human and typical ape forms.

Leakey proposed that the fossil represents an entirely new hominine genus. Others classify it as a separate species of "Australopithecus", Australopithecus platyops, and still others interpret it as an individual of "Australopithecus afarensis".

If some palaeoanthropologists are correct, "Kenyanthropus" may not even represent a valid taxon. The specimen is so distorted by matrix-filled cracks that meaningful morphological characteristics are next to impossible to assess with confidence.

The Southern Vampire Mysteries

The Southern Vampire Mysteries is an adventure, mystery, and romance book series written by author Charlaine Harris. In the story scientists have invented a fake blood for vampires to drink, giving them a chance to live with humans peacefully. Sookie Stackhouse, the main character, meets a vampire in her hometown of "Bon Temps" (a made up place in Louisiana) and falls in love, however she must also solve the mysterious deaths in her town, using her ability to hear people's thoughts.

The book series was first published in 2001, and there are currently eight books all together. In 2007 a television show was created about the books called "True Blood", which is on HBO.



Combot

Combot is a character made for the "Tekken" series. Its first and only appearance was in ""Tekken 4"".

Combot is Mokujin's replacement in Tekken 4 (gameplay wise). Combot didn't mimic a different character every round like Mokujin, instead it changed fighting styles every match.

Combot is a humanoid robot (a robot that was made to act like humans). Lee entered it in the King of Iron Fist Tournament 4 and he used it so he could win. He entered the tournament himself, disguising himself as a man named Violet

Combot is not like any other humanoid robot. A powerful AI function lets it mimic any human motion it can see. With this ability, Combot can do any job from childcare, housekeeping, service industries, and even military duty. 

This Combot is a unique version made for fighting. The making of Combot was very rushed so that it could be finished in time for The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4. 

Lee Chaolan’s plan was to have Combot memorize different of fighting styles as it went through the tournament. Lee was trying to create the most powerful fighting robot in the world and win the Mishima Zaibatsu at the same time. 

The development team did not have enough time to get rid of Combot's problems. As a result, a few bugs remained in its memory when the Tournament started. These bugs stop Combot from mimicking more than one person’s moves each time it starts up.


Lady of the Lake

The Lady of the Lake (welsh name: Arglwyddes y Llyn) is a character of Arthurian legend. Different writers give her different names. Her roles include giving King Arthur his sword, Excalibur, taking Arthur to Camelot after the Battle of Camlann, raising Lancelot after the death of his father, and of enchanting Merlin. She is called Nimue, Viviane, Elaine, Niniane, Nyneve or Nimueh, amongst others.

Disk buffer

A disk buffer is a small amount of memory on a hard drive. Sometimes it is also called cache buffer, or disk cache, but these words should not be used, a disk buffer is not a cache. In early 2015, hard disks usually have between 16 and 128 megabytes of such memory.

When writing data to the disk, the data needs to be written to a certain position on the disk. This is done by a component called disk read/write head. This head needs to be moved to (or near) the correct track. After some settling time the read head begins to pick up bits. Usually, the first sectors to be read are not the ones that have been requested by the operating system. The disk's embedded computer typically saves these unrequested sectors in the disk buffer, in case the operating system requests them later.

The disk is attached to the computer by what is called an I/O interface. This interface almost always works at a different speed than that of the hard disk platter. In such a case, the disk buffer is used to store the data that comes from the disk, before it sent to the computer, or to store the data that comes from the computer before it can be written to the disk.

Modern disks often have a feature called "command queuing" (This is called TCQ in SCSI disks, and NCQ in SATA disks). This means that many commands can be sent at the same time, and the hard disk will put them into the best order. To store the commands and re-order them, the hard disk needs the disk buffer

Pirna

Pirna is a "Große Kreisstadt" in the rural district of Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge in the Free State of Saxony, Germany.

Pirna is located at the beginning of the Elbtalkessel, where the Wesenitz and the Gottleuba flow in the Elbe. In the south of Pirna is the "Osterzgebirge". Pirna is named "Tor zur Sächsischen Schweiz" (door to the Sächsische Schweiz).

Direct in the north of Pirna is the capital of Saxony, Dresden. Nearby towns are Bad Gottleuba-Berggießhübel, Bahretal, Dohma, Dohna, Dürrröhrsdorf-Dittersbach, Heidenau, Lohmen, Stadt Wehlen and Struppen. All these towns are in the rural districts of Sächsische and Schweiz-Osterzgebirge.

The first relics of human settlers are from the last ice age. In the neolithic age, farmers lived in this region. In the 6th century the Sorbs settled in Pirna.

With the foundation of the "Mark Meißen" in the 10th century, it became possible to confirm when the Pirna area had been settled. The castle of Prina was built during the 12th century. Henry III, Margrave of Meissen established the rights of the town of Pirna officially. At this time, the river Elbe was important for trade. The town was first mentioned in writing in 1233. Wenceslaus II of Bohemia bought the town in 1293, so the town was Bohemian until 1405. In 1307, a convent, a complex where nuns lived, was founded in the district.

The table below lists the population change of Pirna since 1300. Since 1960 the population was counted on December 31 every year.

All lead vocals by Joe Strummer, except where noted.


Gavotte

The gavotte was a folk dance, performed by the peasants in the Brittany region of France. Later it was popular in French and English courts in the 17th and 18th centuries. It was especially popular in the French courts of King Louis XIV. 

The music for a gavotte has a four beat feel, with upbeats on beats three and four. To dance a gavotte the dancers must cross their feet twice in each step pattern, with each step followed by a hop. Singers often provided the accompaniment, though dancers might also be accompanied by an ensemble of such instruments as a violin, a drum, bagpipes or shawm, a forerunner of the modern oboe.

The gavotte later became a musical, rather than a dance piece. In the Baroque period gavottes were mainly found in binary form. When composers began writing suites, six short dance based pieces, the gavotte usually was played between the sarabande and the gigue. The best known examples of the gavotte are found in the suites and partitas written by J.S.Bach. 

2009 WWE Draft

The 2009 WWE Draft took place April 13, 2009 at the Phillips Arena in Atlanta, Georgia. It was the sixth yearly draft and the seventh overall. 

The WWE draft is run by World Wrestling Entertainment. It is a way to add to their rosters after separating into two separate rosters (Raw and SmackDown!) in 2002. This is known as the WWE Brand Extension. 

ECW was added as WWE's third brand in 2006. Under the brand extension, superstars are brand exclusive. This means they belong to and perform on brand. A brand uses its brand's show to perform. For example, SmackDown Superstars perform on SmackDown.

The draft was shown on an episode of Raw.

Quartz clock

A quartz clock is a clock that uses an electronic oscillator that is regulated by a quartz crystal to keep time. This crystal oscillator creates a signal with very precise frequency, so that quartz clocks are at least an order of magnitude more accurate than good mechanical clocks. Generally, some form of digital logic counts the cycles of this signal and provides a numeric time display, usually in units of hours, minutes, and seconds. Since the 1970s, they have become the most widely used timekeeping technology.

Ideal gas law

The ideal gas law is the equation of a possible ideal gas, first made by Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron in 1834.

The Mummy (1999 movie)

The Mummy is a 1999 American fantasy adventure horror movie. It is set in Egypt in 1926. Stephen Sommers wrote and directed it. The movie stars Brendan Fraser (acting as Rick O'Connell, who is a person who tries to find treasure so he can sell it), and Rachel Weisz (acting as Evelyn 'Evie' Carnahan, who is a person who learns about the history of Egypt) and Arnold Vosloo, acting as the Mummy. The movie has a lot of talking in the old Egyptian language, which was spoken with the help of a group of people who study it for a job. The movie was first going to be to be part of a few low-budget movies but was later given the money it needed to be made into a big Hollywood movie.

"The Mummy" was seen by people for the first time on May 7, 1999. It earned $43 million from being seen in 3,210 places that weekend. It went on to earn $415 million from being seen in total. Other movies were then made. The first was made in 2001. It is called "The Mummy Returns". A TV programme was made called "". A third movie was then first seen by people on August 1, 2008 and is called "".


The movie won Best Make-Up at Saturn Awards.


Homo sapiens idaltu

Homo sapiens idaltu is an extinct subspecies of "Homo sapiens". They lived almost 160,000 years ago in Africa during the Pleistocene period. "" is the Afar word for "elder, first born".

The fossilized remains of "H. s. idaltu" were discovered in Ethiopia's Afar Triangle in 1997. The region has volcanic layers. By using radiometric dating, the layers date between 154,000 and 160,000 years old. Three well preserved crania (top part of skulls) were discovered, the best preserved being from an adult male (BOU-VP-16/1) with a brain capacity of . 

Later, another even earlier version of "Homo sapiens" was found by a team led by Richard Leakey. These remains were from Omo National Park, Ethiopia. A 2005 potassium-argon dating of volcanic tuff associated with the remains showed them to date from about 195,000 years ago, even older than the "idaltu" fossils. These Omo remains are the earliest known remains of 'anatomically modern humans', that is, modern man. Leakey and his team have not given the remains a subspecific name. They are just called "Omo remains of "Homo sapiens"".

Blue-green

Blue-green is a color that is a deep tone of cyan.

On the older red-yellow-blue pigment color wheel (in which red, yellow and blue were called the primary colors and orange, green, and violet were called the secondary colors), "blue-green" was a third color between blue and green. The other third colors on a red-yellow-blue (RYB) color wheel were called red-violet, blue-violet, yellow-green, yellow-orange and red-orange.



EJB QL

EJB QL or EJB-QL is a portable database query language for Enterprise Java Beans. It can run on any database. It is used in J2EE applications. It is more complex but less powerful than SQL.

The language has been inspired by the native Hibernate Query Language HQL.
EJB QL is a database query language like SQL. The used queries are different from relational SQL. It uses a so-called "abstract schema" of the enterprise beans, not the relational model. In other words, EJB QL queries do not use tables and their components. They use enterprise beans, their persistent state, and their relationships. The result of an SQL query is a set of rows with a fixed number of columns. The result of an EJB QL query is either a single object, a collection of entity objects of a given type, or a collection of values retrieved from CMP fields. One has to understand the data model of enterprise beans in order to write effective queries.


Jakarta Enterprise Beans

Jakarta Enterprise Beans are standardized components inside the Java Enterpise framework. They used to be called Enterprise Java Beans but they were renamed. They make it easier to build multi-tier applications, which can also be distributed. EJBs are a server-side components, that are used for the business logic of an application. 

There are three different types of these beans:

EJBs also support other Enterprise Java features such as managing transactions, when needed.

Looking at a simple example of a online shop, it is possible to define the different tasks: A client comes along and performs some searches. The result of these searches are stored in "stateless session beans". The client then goes, and buys different products. The "shopping cart" is modeleled as a "stateful session bean". When the client checks out the goods, some data needs to be recorded, such as where to send the goods, or what method of payment to use. This data is later persited to a database, the client will get a way to log in. Usually, "entity beans" are used for this. To actually perform the checkout, message-driven beans are often used (for example to check if the credit card number is valid, or if the credit card can be used for payment. Finally, the sending of the goods needs to be provided, which is often done by sending messages to other systems.

When they are done in Java, so-called web-services are done using stateless session beans

Habitable zone

A habitable zone (HZ) in astronomy is a region of space where conditions are best for life to form as on Earth. Planets in these areas are the most likely to have extraterrestrial life.

The habitable zone may also be called the "life zone", "comfort zone", "green belt" or "Goldilocks zone". One in five stars has an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone. However, it is not known what proportion would have conditions suitable for life.

The Goldilocks principle or 'Goldilocks effect' is that something must be within limits: "not too hot, not too cold, but just right".

It is taken from a children's story "The Three Bears" in which a little girl named Goldilocks finds a house owned by three bears. Each bear has their own preference of food, beds, etc. After testing each of the three items, Goldilocks determines that one of them is always too much in one extreme (too hot, too large, etc.), one is too much in the opposite extreme (too cold, too small, etc.), and one is "just right".

In astrobiology, the Goldilocks zone refers to the habitable zone around a star. A planet must neither be too far away from, nor too close to a star and galactic centre to support life. Either extreme would prevent a planet evolving life. 
Such a planet is colloquially called a "Goldilocks planet".

In a solar system, astronomers believe a planet must be in the habitable zone to have life. The circumstellar habitable zone is an area around a star where a planet would be able to have liquid water. Liquid water may be necessary for all forms of life.

Bigger stars are generally hotter, so the circumstellar habitable zone would be farther away from the star than for the Sun. Smaller stars are cooler, so the circumstellar habitable zone would be closer to the star than for the Sun. The size and brightness of a star determine where the circumstellar habitable zone is found around the star.

Planets are evaluated on these seven criteria:

This concept is not so widely used. It is the idea that a solar system must also be in a suitable place inside a galaxy for life to form.

Some areas of galaxies are better suited to life than others. The Solar System in which we live, in the Orion Spur, on the Milky Way galaxy's edge is a life-favorable spot, since we are there.

The habitable zone is the region around a star where a planet has sufficient atmospheric pressure to keep liquid water on its surface.

A "habitable planet candidate" implies a terrestrial planet within the zone, and with conditions roughly comparable to those of the Earth (i.e. an Earth analog) and thus potentially favourable to life.

Only about a dozen planets have been confirmed in the habitable zone, but the Kepler spacecraft has identified a further 54 candidates. Estimates suggest that there are "at least 500 million" such planets in the Milky Way.

Ernst Röhm

Ernst Julius Gunther Röhm (28 November 1887 ; in Munich,Bavaria,Germany– 1 July 1934 ; in Munich, Bavaria, Germany) was a leader and co-founder of the German Sturmabteilung, the Stormtroopers. He also was a member of the German Reichstag, where he was a minister from 1933 to 1934. He was murdered during the Night of the Long Knives, in 1934. Adolf Hitler gave the order to murder Röhm. He was gay.

During the First World War, Röhm fought as an officer. He was awarded the Iron Cross First Class.

Ernst Röhm was born in Munich on 28 November 1887. He was the third child of a chief train inspector, Julius Röhm, and his wife, Emilie Röhm. He had one older brother and one older sister. His sister's son was Bernhard Lippert, a German diplomat.

In 1906, after his Abitur (school exams) in Munich, Röhm joined the Bavarian army as a Fanjunkare. Two years later he became a Lieutenant.

In 1914, at the beginning of the First World War, he was an adjutant and fought on the Western Front. He was wounded three times, and was awarded the Iron Cross First Class. He was badly hurt in that year and lost a piece of his nasal bone. He worked for the Bavarian government in the War Department for the first time. Two years later, in 1918, he was given the rank of a captain (German: "Hauptmann").

After the First World War, Röhm went to the Freikorps (Free Corps) of Franz Ritter von Epp. He wanted to fight against the Communists in Munich. With this group, he went to fight against the Bavarian Soviet Republic. In July 1919, the Freikorps became part of the Reichswehr.

In 1919, Röhm joined the German Workers' Party (German: "Deutsche Arbeiter Partei (DAP)"). This was the precursor of the Nazi party. One year later, he became a member of the German Nazi Party. He received the membership number 623. Röhm helped Hitler establish relationships with the Bavarian politicians and the industrialists. Two years later, Röhm and Hitler started the Sturmabteilung (SA), attracting many men from the Freikorps. It was founded as a paramilitary group for the German Nazi Party. Hitler made Röhm the leader of the SA.

Röhm took a part in the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. The Nazi Party tried to overthrow the government, but failed. Röhm was arrested and charged with high treason. The judges decided he was guilty on 1 April 1924. Röhm went to prison for five months and lost his job in the army. Following the court trial, both the Nazi Party and the Sturmabteilung became illegal.

In 1924, Röhm helped start the "Frontbann", an alternative to the Sturmabteilung. After an argument with Adolf Hitler, Röhm retired as leader of the SA. He said that he was only a soldier and not a politician. Between 1928 and 1930, he worked for the Bolivian military as an advisor.

On 1 November 1930, he went back to Germany and joined the Nazi Party a second time. In January 1931, Adolf Hitler placed Röhm in charge of the Sturmabteilung. In just over a year, he expanded it from 70,000 to 170,000 members. In April 1932, Chancellor Heinrich Brüning banned the SA again. Franz von Papen, who was chancellor after Heinrich Brüning, annulled the ban in June. In 1933, Ernst Röhm became a "Reichsminister", a minister of the Reichstag. In 1934, the SA had over 4,500,000 members. The power of the SA increased. Because of this, Adolf Hitler and the Schutzstaffel (SS) started a new dispute with Röhm. The SA was about 20 times greater in membership than the "Reichswehr"; Röhm was dreaming to take over the "Reichswehr".

Hitler was afraid of Röhm's power. Röhm wanted to merge the Sturmabteilung with the general army, with him as leader. He also wanted a "second Nazi revolution" to make Germany more socialist. He was an anticapitalist, and at this time, Hitler was trying to befriend Germany's industrialists. Hitler planned to kill Röhm.

Röhm arranged with Hitler that the Sturmabteilung would get four weeks holiday during the summer of 1934. The holiday started on 1 July 1934. Röhm wanted to go to Bad Wiessee for rest. On 29 June 1934, Röhm was arrested, yet had no trial. He was given the choice by Theodor Eicke: to commit suicide or be killed. On 1 July, Theodor Eicke shot Röhm as instructed by Hitler. Röhm was buried in the Munich western cemetery.

Many Sturmabteilung leaders were killed on that same night, mostly by the Schutzstaffel and Gestapo. It was called the "Night of the Long Knives". The next day the German parliament passed a law with only one paragraph making the murders at the Night of the Long Knives legal.

Feud

A feud () (also called blood feud or vendetta) is a long-running argument or fight between parties. In most cases it involves whole familles or clans. People are seen as guilty, not because they did something, but because they were seen with other people (who are considered guilty). This is called guilt by association.

Feuds start because one party thinks they were attacked, insulted, or harmed by the other party. Intense feelings of resentment trigger the initial revenge, which causes the other party to feel the same way. The dispute is then fueled by a long-running cycle of retaliatory violence. This ongoing cycle of provocation and retaliation makes it very difficult to end the feud peacefully. Feuds frequently involve the original parties' family members and/or associates. They can last for generations.

Up to the early modern period, feuds were considered legitimate legal instruments. The state or ruler even made laws for certain aspects of feuds. Once modern centralizing states asserted and enforced a monopoly on legitimate use of force, feuds became illegal.

A blood feud is a feud with a cycle of retaliatory violence, with the relatives of someone who has been killed or otherwise wronged or dishonored. The wronged person then wants vengeance and kills the culprits or punishes them in other ways. If he cannot get the culprits, he does this to their relatives. Usually, the closest male relative of the person killed or wronged maintained the vendetta, but other members of the family may do so as well.

Historically, the word vendetta has been used to mean a blood feud. The word is Italian, and originates from the Latin "vindicta", "vengeance." In modern times, the word also means any other long-standing feud, not necessarily involving bloodshed. 

Vendetta is typical of societies with a weak rule of law or in those where the state does not consider itself responsible for helping with this kind of dispute. In such societies, family and kinship ties are the main source of authority. An entire family is considered responsible for whatever one of them has done. Sometimes two branches of the same family could come to blows over some matter. Today, the practice of vendetta has almost disappeared in societies where law enforcement works. There, criminal law punishes lawbreakers.

In ancient Greece, the practice of personal vengeance against wrongdoers was considered natural and customary: "Embedded in the Greek morality of retaliation is the right of vendetta . . . Vendetta is a war, just as war is an indefinite series of vendettas; and such acts of vengeance are sanctioned by the gods". Throughout history, the Maniots—one of Greece's toughest populations—have been known by their neighbors and their enemies as fearless warriors who practice blood feuds. Some vendettas went on for months and sometimes years. The families involved would lock themselves in their towers and when they got the chance would murder members of the opposing family.

The Ancient Hebrew tribes considered it to be the duty of the individual and family to avenge evil in God's name. The person who put the initial aggressive killer to death was given a special name: "go'el haddam", the blood-avenger or blood-redeemer (Num. 35: 19, etc.). Six cities of refuge were made to provide a "cooling off" phase as well as due process for the accused. As the "Oxford Companion to the Bible" states: "Since life was viewed as sacred (Gen. 9.6), no amount of blood money could be given as recompense for the loss of the life of an innocent person; it had to be 'life for life'" (Exod. 21.23; Deut. 19.21)".

According to medievalist Marc Bloch, "The Middle Ages, from beginning to end, and particularly the feudal era, lived under the sign of private vengeance. The onus, of course, lay above all on the wronged individual; vengeance was imposed on him as the most sacred of duties ... The solitary individual, however, could do but little. Moreover, it was most commonly a death that had to be avenged. In this case the family group went into action and the "faide" (feud) came into being, to use the old Germanic word which spread little by little through the whole of Europe--'the vengeance of the kinsmen which we call "faida"', as a German canonist expressed it. No moral obligation seemed more sacred than this ... The whole kindred, therefore, placed as a rule under the command of a chieftain, took up arms to punish the murder of one of its members or merely a wrong that he had suffered" (Marc Bloch, trans. L. A. Manyon, "Feudal Society", Vol. I, 1965, p. 125-126).

The Celtic phenomenon of the "blood feud" demanded "an eye for an eye," and usually descended into murder. Disagreements between clans might last for generations in Scotland and Ireland. Due to the Celtic heritage of many whites living in Appalachia, a series of prolonged violent engagements in late- nineteenth-century Kentucky and West Virginia were referred to commonly as feuds, a tendency that was partly due to the nineteenth-century popularity of William Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott, authors who both wrote semihistorical accounts of blood feuds. These incidents, the most famous of which was the Hatfield-McCoy feud, were regularly featured in the newspapers of the eastern U.S. between the 1880s and the early twentieth century. 

In Japan's feudal past the Samurai class upheld the honor of their family, clan, or their lord by "katakiuchi", or revenge killings. These killings could also involve the relatives of an offender. While some vendettas were punished by the government, such as that of the 47 Ronin, others were given official permission with specific targets.

At the Holy Roman Empire's "Reichstag" at Worms in 1495 the right of waging feuds was abolished. The Imperial Reform proclaimed an "eternal public peace" ("Ewiger Landfriede") to put an end to the abounding feuds and the anarchy of the robber barons and it defined a new standing imperial army to enforce that peace. However, it took a few more decades until the new regulation was universally accepted. In 1506, for example, knight Jan Kopidlansky killed somebody in Prague and the Town Councillors sentenced him to death and had him executed. Brother Jiri Kopidlansky revenged himself by continuing atrocities.

In Corsica, vendetta was a social code that required Corsicans to kill anyone who wronged the family honor. It has been estimated that between 1683 and 1715, nearly 30,000 out of 120,000 Corsicans lost their lives to vendetta.

The Basque Country in the Late Middle Ages was ravaged by bitter partisan wars between local ruling families. In Navarre, these conflicts became polarised in a violent struggle between the Agramont and Beaumont parties. In Biscay, the two major warring factions were named Oinaz and Gamboa. ("Cf." the Guelphs and Ghibellines in Italy). High defensive structures ("towers") built by local noble families, few of which survive today, were frequently razed by fires, sometimes by royal decree.

Leontiy Lyulye, an expert on conditions in the Caucasus, wrote in the mid-19th century: "Among the mountain people the blood feud is not an uncontrollable permanent feeling such as the vendetta is among the Corsicans. It is more like an obligation imposed by the public opinion." In the Dagestani aul Kadar, one blood feud between two antagonistic clans lasted for nearly 260 years, from the 17th century till the 1860s.

An alternative to feud was "blood money" (or "weregild" in the Norse culture), which demanded payment of some kind from those responsible for a wrongful death (even an accidental one). If these payments were not made or were refused by the offended party, a blood feud would happen.

Vendetta is reputedly still practiced in some areas in France (especially Corsica) and Italy (especially Sicily, Sardinia, Campania, Calabria, Apulia, and other areas of Southern Italy), in Crete (Greece), among Kurdish clans in Iraq and Turkey, in northern Albania, among Pashtuns in Afghanistan, among Somali clans, over land in Nigeria, in India (caste-related feuds among rival Hindu groups), between rival tribes in the north-east Indian state of Assam, among rival clans in China and Philippines, among the Arab Bedouins and Arab tribes inhabiting the mountains of Yemen and between Shiites and Sunnis in Iraq, in southern Ethiopia, among the highland tribes of New Guinea, in Svaneti, in the mountainous areas of Dagestan, many northern areas of Georgia and Azerbaijan, a number of republics of the northern Caucasus and essentially among Chechen teips where those seeking retribution do not accept or respect the local law enforcement authority. Vendettas are generally helped by local law enforcement ignoring them. 

In Albania, the blood feud has returned in rural areas after more than 40 years of being abolished by Albanian communists led by Enver Hoxha. More than 5,500 Albanian families are currently engaged in blood feuds. In 2008 there were more than 20,000 men and boys who live under an ever-present death sentence because of blood feuds. Since 1992, at least 10,000 Albanians have been killed due to blood feuds.

Mutual vendetta may develop into a vicious circle of further killings, retaliation, counterattacks, and all-out warfare that can end in the mutual extinction of both families. Often the original cause is forgotten, and feuds continue simply because there has always been a feud.

There is a scene in "The Godfather," in which Michael Corleone, hiding from U.S. police in Sicily, walks through a village with his two bodyguards. Michael asks, "Where are all the men?" The bodyguard replies, "They're all dead from vendettas."

In the game "" by Rockstar, one of the main themes in the plot are continuous rivalries and vendettas between Italian Mafia families in Liberty City (based on New York City).

Some of the gang wars between organized crime groups are effectively forms of vendetta, where the criminal organization (like the Mafia "family") has taken the place of blood relatives.

In the English language, "Wikipedia" is a portmanteau word made by "Wiki" (A technology that allows many people working together) and "encyclopedia". At first, "Wikipedia" did not have a Chinese name. The site was called "Zhongwen Wikipedia" (中文Wikipedia, Chinese Wikipedia). On October 21, 2003, Wikipedia's Chinese name "Weiji Baike" (维基百科/維基百科, meaning Weiji Encyclopedia) was decided by the Chinese wiki community (13 people voted). The pronunciation of "Weiji" is like the pronunciation of "Wiki". "Wei" (维/維) means rope that can link things, or net. "Ji" (基) means basic, or base. So "Weiji Baike" means "the encyclopedia on the Internet that covers human's all basic knowledge".

Keymer

Keymer is a village in West Sussex, England. It is on the B2116 road 2.4 miles south of Burgess Hill.

Keymer used to be a village on its own until it was merged into the modern day village of Hassocks. Keymer's records go back as far as The Domesday Book. Keymer is situated just to the east of Hassocks and is only a matter of a few hundred yards from the boundary with East Sussex. It has a fine parish church unusually called St Cosmas and St Damian Church. The oldest part of Keymer can be found in the area of this church and the Greyhound Pub.

To the north-east of Keymer can be found Oldland Mill dating from the 17th Century. It is one of the few remaining windmills still standing in the south-east. The new burial ground that is now run by Hassocks Parish Council can be found located to the east of the Greyhound Pub.

Empty set

In mathematics, the empty set is the set that has nothing in it. It is often written as formula_1, formula_2, formula_3. For example, consider the set of integer numbers between two and three. Since there is no integer between two and three, the set of integer numbers between them is "empty".

Any statement about all elements of the empty set is automatically true. For example, all integers between two and three are greater than seven. This only makes sense because there are no integers between two and three. This kind of truth is called vacuous truth.

Note that the symbol formula_1 comes from the Latin letter Ø, and not the Greek letter φ. The empty set is also sometimes called the null set.


2009 Victorian bushfires

The 2009 Victorian bushfires (also called the Black Saturday bushfires) were more than 400 bushfires that started in Victoria, Australia on February 7, 2009. They ended on the March 14, 2009. The fires lasted for around 1 month. The fires caused Australia's highest ever loss of life from bushfire. Police say that 173 people died, and 414 people were taken to hospitals with bad burns. At first the death toll was thought to be 210 but forensic tests have shown there were 173 people killed and the death toll was revised.
Most of the fires began and spread on a day of some of the worst bushfire weather ever recorded. The temperature in Victoria reached 46 degrees Celsius and wind speed was more than 100 km/h. The wind blew the fires over large distances and areas, creating large firestorms. North-east of Melbourne, a single firestorm killed 120 people. A cool change came to the state in the early evening. It had gale force south-westerly winds of more than 120 km/h. This change in wind direction caused the long eastern sides of the fires to become wide fire fronts. These burned quickly towards towns that were not in the bushfires yet.

Many of the fires were started by fallen or clashing power lines or were deliberately lit. Some were also caused by lightning, cigarette butts, and sparks from a power tool. A ten-year drought made the land and forests very dry. They burnt quickly. In March, the weather changed and the fire fighters were able to put out the fires.

Starting at the end of January, south east Australia had days of very hot weather, called a heatwave. The heatwave was caused by a slow moving high-pressure system over the Tasman Sea, a big tropical cyclone off the north west Australian coast, and a monsoon trough over northern Australia. This caused hot tropical air to travel down over south eastern Australia.

The February fires started on the hottest day ever in Victoria, where temperature records have been kept since 1859. On 6 February 2009 (the day before the fires) Premier of Victoria John Brumby told people that very hot weather was coming, and that there was a big danger of bushfires. He told people to be very careful. Premier Brumby also said that it would be the "worst day of fire conditions in the history of the state".

At the end of January, there were fires in the Gippsland area of Victoria. These included a small tree fire near Delburn, Victoria and one which nearly burnt a pine tree plantation.
There were two small grass fires near the city of Sale, Victoria, which were deliberately lit.

On 29 January, over 500 firemen fought the two fires at Delburn which had joined together into one big fire. The fires had burnt near Boolarra and Darlimurra, south of the city of Morwell. No buildings were burnt. A cool change in the weather on 30 January made it easier to fight the fires, but also made it windy, which led to spot fires (new, small fires from burning plants blown ahead). On the evening of 31 January, fire crews worked to stop the fire spreading to the north. They fought to protect the main power transmission lines taking electricity to Melbourne from the Latrobe Valley. The fire was also close to the Hazelwood Power Station, Victoria.

By February 1, firemen had made fire breaks (clear areas) around the Boolarra fire, although it was still burning out of control. The fire had burned through and destroyed 29 houses, farm buildings and animals. Police believed the Delburn and Boolarra fires were deliberately lit. They offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of people who lit the fires.

On February 2, lightning started 23 new fires. This included three in the Bunyip State Park, and fires near Drouin West and Leongatha. However, increased humidity helped stop the fires spreading. On February 3, the Country Fire Authority grouped the fires into six areas. Five fires were under control, but one, near Mirboo North, was not.

The major fires include:

The Kinglake fire, was named when two fires joined together after the wind changed direction on February 7 and 8. The fire had burned over by February 8. 147 people died in the Kinglake fire.

The first of the two fires started at Kilmore East, Victoria, on the afternoon February 7 2009, and burned south-east towards St. Andrews through Wandong and Clonbinane. The fire destroyed 30 houses at Wandong and Heathcote Junction on February 7. By February 8, 150 houses had been destroyed at Wandong, and four people killed. The fire closed the Seymour railway line, and parts of the Hume Highway near Kilmore. The north west winds blew the front of the fire towards St Andrews, before the weather changed about 7.30pm, changing the wind to the south west. The wind change turned the long, narrow fire, into a wide fire front that moved north east to Kinglake and Strathewen.

By the evening of February 8, 100 people who had escaped the Kilmore fire, were sheltering in a basketball stadium at Wallan. Many of them were unable to go back to their homes because the police had closed the roads.

The fire front burned through the Kinglake area on February 7. This was the worst fire area in the state, with 37 people killed, and more than 550 houses destroyed. Another 12 people died at Kinglake West, and in Strathewen, 27.

The second fire destroyed the town of Marysville, Victoria. It started north of Marysville, and at first people thought it would go around the town, but within minutes the town was an inferno. At about 5.00pm, electric power was lost, and the wind stopped. Minutes later the wind came back from a different direction, bringing the fire up the valley with it. Damage to the water treatment plant at Marysville made the water unsafe to drink. On February 11, it was said that 100 people of the town's population of 500 were believed to have died, and that only a few buildings were left. Premier Brumby said: "There's no activity, there's no people, there's no buildings, there's no birds, there's no animals, everything's just gone." These numbers were later revised, but 40 people did die, and nearly every building in the town was damaged or destroyed.

Radio-frequency identification

Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is a technology used to record the presence of an object using radio signals. It is used for inventory control or timing sporting events. RFID is not a replacement for barcoding, but a complement for distant reading of codes.
The technology is used for automatically identifying a person, a package or an item. To do this, it relies on "RFID tags". These are small "transponders" (combined radio "receiver" and "transmitter") that will transmit identity information over a short distance, when asked. The other piece to make use of RFID tags is an RFID tag reader.

An RFID tag is an object that can be applied to or incorporated into a product, animal, or person for the purpose of identification and tracking using radio waves. Some tags can be read from several meters away and beyond the line of sight of the reader. Most tags carry a plain text inscription and a barcode as complements for direct reading and for cases of any failure of radio frequency electronics.

Most RFID tags contain at least two parts. One is an integrated circuit for storing and processing information, modulating and de-modulating a "radio-frequency" (RF) signal, and other specialized functions. The second is an antenna for receiving and transmitting the signal.

There are generally two types of RFID tags: active RFID tags, which contain a battery, and passive RFID tags, which have no batteries

RFID systems are used for the following:

Hurricane Opal

Hurricane Opal was a major hurricane that formed in the Gulf of Mexico in September 1995.

Opal was the 9th hurricane of the highly active 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. Opal was the strongest hurricane of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. It crossed the Yucatán Peninsula while still a tropical depression from September 27, then strengthened northward in the Gulf, becoming the most powerful Category 4 Atlantic hurricane before making a second landfall, October 4, in the Florida Panhandle near Pensacola as a 125-mph (201-km/h) hurricane. Opal devastated the Pensacola/Panhandle area with a 15-ft (5-m) storm surge and travelled up the entire state of Alabama, becoming a tropical storm in Tennessee. Opal also caused heavy damage in the mid-Atlantic states before dissipating.

Afterward, 50 people had died from flooding by Opal in Guatemala and Mexico, with another 13 deaths in the United States directly or indirectly related to Opal. Preliminary damage estimates were $3 billion.

The beginning of this storm started from a tropical wave that moved off of Africa on September 11. It disappeared into a low pressure while in the Caribbean Sea several days later. The wave was found again on September 27 and was good enough to become Tropical Depression Eighteen. Tropical Depression Eighteen made landfall in the Yucatán Peninsula shortly afterword. On September 30 Tropical Depression Eighteen strengthened into Tropical Storm Opal. Tropical Storm Opal continued west until October 2. On October 2 it turned northeast and strengthened into Hurricane Opal. After that Hurricane Opal strengthened fast and reached it's top winds of 150 mph (making it a category 4) on October 4, only two days after becoming a hurricane. Hurricane Opal continued northeast and weakened a little and made its last landfall in Santa Rosa Island, Florida on October 4 while a category 3 hurricane. Hurricane Opal became a tropical storm over central Alabama and did not weaken to a tropical depression till it was in Tennessee. Tropical Depression Opal became extratropical over the Ohio River Valley on October 5th.

The name "Opal" was retired in the spring of 1996. In 2001, the name "Olga" was used instead, Olga was also used in 2007, and could be used in 2013.


Hurricane Charley

Hurricane Charley was the second hurricane and also the second major hurricane (category 3+) of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. Charley lasted from August 9 to August 15. Its strongest winds were 150 mph (240 km/h), classifying it as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.
The storm made landfall in southwestern Florida. It was the strongest hurricane to hit the United States since Hurricane Andrew, twelve years earlier. In the United States, Charley caused ten deaths and $15.4 billion in damage (2004 USD).

Charley did its damage in a very similar manner to Andrew: high winds caused almost all the damage, and both storms made landfall at low tide, preventing the storm surges from causing damage like they usually do when hurricanes make landfall. Both were compact storms upon landfall.

Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski

Erich Julius Eberhard von Zelewski or Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski (1 March 1899 – 8 March 1972), was a Nazi leader and a member of the SS, where he had the rank of "SS-Obergruppenführer". Although he was involved in the killing of thousands of people in Poland and Russia, he was never charged with war crimes.

His parents were Otto Jan Józefat von Zelewski, a Roman Catholic, and his wife Elisabeth Eveline Schimansky, a Lutheran. His name when he was born was Erich Julius Eberhard von Zelewski. He later changed his last name to add "von dem Bach" in the 1930s. He removed "Zelewski" from his name in November 1941 because of its Polish sound.

He was born in Lauenburg, in Pomerania, in the old German Empire (now called Lębork, Poland), on 1 March 1899. His family did not have very much money during his childhood. His father was often out of work. When his father died on April 17, 1911, in Dortmund, he was employed as an insurance clerk. His father's lack of success was partly because he was the brother of Emil von Zalewski, the leader of a colonial force fighting in Tanzania. On August 17, 1891, he and his men were killed in the battle of Rugarto, described as being like a German Custer at the Battle of Little Bighorn. This death and defeat brought great shame to the family. Erich would later restore his family's position in the community.

After his father's death, his uncle Oskar von Zalewski, a soldier, became very close to Erich and told Erich to become a soldier. In November 1914 Erich von Zalewski asked to join the Prussian army, and was one of the youngest soldiers and remained a soldier fighting for the army until the end of World War I. He was wounded twice, and was given the Cross of Honor (Ehrenkreuz) and then Iron Cross.

After the war, he stayed in the army and fought in the Silesian Uprisings, where he earned a reputation (what other people believe about a person) for courage. He was given more medals. In 1924, he joined "Grenzschutz" (border guards). On October 23, 1925, he changed his last name to `von dem Bach-Zalewski`.

He left the "Grenzschutz" in 1930, when he joined the Nazi Party, becoming a member of the SS in 1931. He was quickly promoted and by the end of 1933 had reached the rank of "SS-Brigadeführer". However, he quarreled with his staff officer Anton von Hohberg und Buchwald.

Three of his sisters married Jewish men, and in 1946 he said that this ruined his reputation in the army and he was forced to leave.

He was a member of the Reichstag from 1932 to 1944, he took part in the Night of the Long Knives in 1934, and had Anton von Hohberg und Buchwald murdered. He served in many Nazi party jobs, first in East Prussia and after 1936 in Silesia. By 1937 he had become the "Höherer SS- und Polizeiführer" ("HSSPF" – Higher SS and Police Leader) in Silesia.

After the war started, units under his command took part in revenge and in the shooting of POWs during the September Campaign, but von dem Bach was not there in person. On 7 November 1939, the SS chief Heinrich Himmler asked him if he wanted the job of "Commissioner for the Strengthening of Germandom" in Silesia. His duty was to force people to leave and to take their property. By August 1940, his units had forced more than 20,000 Żywiec families to leave their homes.

In late 1939, he suggested starting a concentration camp for the non-German people who lived in the town of Oświęcim. Heinrich Himmler agreed to von dem Bach's suggestion and in May 1940 the Auschwitz concentration camp opened.

On 22 June 1941, von dem Bach-Zelewski became "HSSPF" in the "Heeresgruppe Mitte" (Army Group Center); in July 1943, he became commander of the ""Bandenkämpfverbände"" ("Band-fighting Units"), that carried out the mass murder of 35,000 people in Riga and more than 200,000 in Belarus and eastern Poland. The government was going to make him the future "HSSPF" in Moscow; however, the Wehrmacht did not get into the city. Until 1943, von dem Bach-Zalewski was the "HSSPF" in command of "anti-partisan" units on the "central front", a special command created by Adolf Hitler. Von dem Bach-Zalewski was the only "HSSPF" in the Soviet areas taken over by the Germans to have real authority over the police after Hans-Adolf Prützmann and Jockeln lost theirs to the civil government.

In February 1942, he was put into hospital, which he would later say was due to a nervous breakdown because of the ethnic cleansing in Belarus, and the genocide of the Jews. Radio signals overheard by British intelligence say, however, that his illness was physical. He went back to his job in July, with no reduction seen in his actions.

In June 1942, after the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in Prague, Adolf Hitler wanted von dem Bach-Zelewski to take Heydrich's job as Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia. When Himmler said that von dem Bach-Zelewski was needed due to the situation in Belarus, Hitler let him stay and gave the job to Kurt Daluege.

On 12 July 1943, von dem Bach-Zalewski was given command of all anti-partisan efforts in Belgium, Belarus, France, the General Government, the Netherlands, Norway, Ukraine, Yugoslavia, and parts of the Bialystok District. In reality he remained only in Belarus and the area of Russia near Belarus.

In 1944, von dem Bach-Zalewski took part in front line fighting in the Kovel area, but in March had to go to Germany for medical treatment. Himmler took over all his jobs.

On 2 August 1944, he took command of all soldiers fighting against the Warsaw Uprising as "Korpsgruppe Bach". Units under his command killed about 200,000 people including more than 65,000 executions, and an unknown number of POWs. After more than two months of heavy fighting and the total destruction of Warsaw he then was able to control the city. For what he did in Warsaw, the Nazi Government gave him the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on September 30, 1944.


Von dem Bach-Zelewski went into hiding and tried to leave the country. However, US military police arrested him on 1 August, 1945. Because he told the Allies what he knew about his former bosses at the Nuremberg Trials, von dem Bach-Zelewski never went to trial himself for any war crimes. He also did not have to go back to Poland or to the USSR to be tried. He left prison in 1949.

In 1951, von dem Bach-Zalewski said that he had helped Hermann Göring kill himself in 1946. To make people believe this he showed them the cyanide with serial numbers like the ones that were on the cyanide that Göring used. This was never proven. Today people who study history do not believe this happened.

Also in 1951, von dem Bach was told he would go to a work prison for ten years for the murder of people in the early 1930s; but he did not go until 1958, when he was found guilty of killing Anton von Hohberg und Buchwald, an SS officer on the Night of the Long Knives and was sentenced to four and a half years in prison. In 1961, he received an extra ten years where he had to stay in his home all the time for the murder of ten German Communists in the early 1930s. He never went to prison for crimes during the war even though he openly said he murdered Jews. He died in a Munich prison on 8 March 1972.

It has been said that Hitler really liked von dem Bach-Zalewski because he was very good at his job and said that von dem Bach was "so clever he can do anything, get around anything."



Will Mellor

William "Will" Mellor (born 3 April 1976 in Bredbury, Stockport, Greater Manchester) is an English actor and former pop star. 

Mellor lived as a child in the Bredbury area of Stockport going to Bredbury Green Primary School and later going to Werneth School, Greater Manchester, and was the youngest of the family with four older sisters: Janice, Cheryl, Joanne and Sarah.

Specialized English

Specialized English is a controlled version of the English language used for radio broadcasting, easier for non-native speakers of English. It is based on Voice of America (VoA) Special English.

Specialized English was set up initially by Feba Radio in the UK. Feba now uses Specialized English with US radio companies Words of Hope and Back to God Ministries International. All three are Christian, but Specialized English is not used for religious preaching programs. Its main use is in the features service program 'Spotlight', which is widely broadcast on over sixty outlets globally. Scripts and audio are also available freely on the Spotlight website.

Specialized English sounds the same as Special English, and it almost is the same. Both use a 1500 word core vocabulary, short sentences, and slow delivery (about 90 words per minute). Special English was used from about 1959 by Voice of America. Specialized was written in the late 1990's, independently of Voice of America. The basic design is identical, but there is a slight difference in the vocabulary, and Specialized is more international. VoA is a federal US government department, so it doesn't make Special English programs for anything other than VoA's own use. Specialized English was designed by the civil society, and the developers try to make programs for several purposes. The developers of Specialized felt they should choose a name to show both the similarity and the difference.

The reason that Specialized was based on Special English is related to their respective usage. They are not primarily teaching tools (even though they are popular as an aid to learning) but communication tools. The choice of words in the 1500 word list depends to a degree on what is to be communicated. Most of the words are the most frequently learned, most commonly used English words. Both tools use these words. But many words are chosen for the intended purpose. For example, Special English uses words a US government news service might need, such as Congress, federal, administration, capitalism and recession. Specialized replaces some of these words with words used for religious subjects, such as blessing, prayer, miracle, and faith. The Specialized English word list has been revised in 2000 and 2007, in the light of experience. Still, the overlap of the two vocabularies is 91.3%. The Specialized English word list allows greater breadth of meaning in some of the words used in both lists. For example, the word 'joint':

Special: joint - ad. shared by two or more

Specialized: joint - ad. shared by two or more; n. the place where two parts or things are fixed together.

Specialized also allows more prefixes and suffixes, which has allowed some words to be removed from the core list. (e.g.: wonderful not needed in the list because it can be built from wonder+ful)

As well as the 1500 word core vocabulary, both Special and Specialized English also generally allow: inflections of the core words, numbers up to a million, pronouns, proper nouns, and any words whose meaning can be communicated in real time (in a radio broadcast) using the core vocabulary.

The following table lists some differences between the two methods.

Consett

Fountain

A Fountain is an arrangement, usually made by man; in it, the water from a source is captured in some way. Most often, it is used to fill a basin of some kind. Sometimes there are many basins, and water runs from one into the next. It is also common to have sculptures in fountains. 

Sometimes jets are used to make the water go high into the air, using pressure.

Steamboat

A steamboat (also called a steamship or steamer) is a ship that uses a steam engine or steam turbine to move. At first, these were paddle steamboats. Some had a paddle wheel on the back. Others had two wheels on the sides. Most went down rivers. From about 1836, marine propellers, invented by Josef Ressel, were used. Claude François Jouffroy d’Abbans built the first working steamship in 1783.

There were many steamboats in the 19th century in the United States and other countries. However, the first steamboat was built by John Fitch in 1787. It had many paddles. Fitch tried to make money from the steamboat, but could not do so. He died in 1798, and did not live long enough to see Robert Fulton become the first person to build a steamboat that could make money. In 1807, Fulton built a steamboat that could travel from New York City to Albany in 32 hours. Steamboats became much faster later in the 19th century.

After the middle 19th century paddle steamers became rare, as the marine propeller gave more speed and burned less fuel. The new vessels were suited to the open ocean, and were usually called "steamships". During the 20th century, marine Diesel engines largely replaced steam propulsion.

Hurricane Carol

Hurricane Carol was one of the worst hurricanes in New England, which is in United States. Carol formed from a tropical wave near the Bahamas on August 25, 1954.

Carol was like the New England Hurricane of 1938. Both were fast-moving storms. They also both hit the same area. Carol was the most damaging United States hurricane at the time.

Hurricane Carol was later retired (meaning it was not used for any more hurricanes afterwards) due to the impact in New England. The name "Carol" was the first name to be retired from the Atlantic hurricane name lists.

Field (mathematics)

In mathematics, a field is a certain kind of algebraic structure. In a field, one can add (formula_1), subtract (formula_2), multiply (formula_3) and divide (formula_4) two numbers (with division only possible if formula_5 is non-zero). A field is a special ring in which division is possible. Both the set of rational numbers and the set of real numbers are examples of fields. The set of integers, formula_6, is not a field, because the result of a division is not always an integer. One can also use the symbol formula_7 as a variable for a field.

Since a field is always a ring, it consists of a set (represented here with the letter R) with two operations: addition (+) and multiplication (•). The properties of a ring are:



A field is a ring (so it follows the rules above), with these extra rules:

Another way of describing a field is this:

Examples of fields include: 
In fact, among the subsets of complex numbers, the largest field is formula_10 and the smallest field is formula_8.

Violone

The violone (pronounced: "Vee-o-LOH-ne") is a very big string instrument that used to be used in the 16th and 17th centuries. It is like a double bass, but it belongs to the viol family. The name "violone" means "large viol". It was really a "double-bass viola da gamba". It usually had six strings, and the fingerboard had frets (like a guitar) which showed where to put the fingers of the left hand to make the notes. The bow was held underhand (with the palm of the hand facing up).

The violone is sometimes heard today in early music groups who are playing Renaissance and early Baroque music music. The instruments used today are usually ones that have been made recently to look and sound like the old ones.

The violone was the last member of the viol family to die out. When the other sizes of viol had been replaced by orchestras with violins, violas and cellos the violone was often used instead of a double bass. Bach used the violone in his cantatas. Eventually the violone was no longer used, and the double bass was used instead. The double bass still looks a little bit like the old viol because it has sloping shoulders and the strings are tuned in fourths.

In organs "Violone" is the name given to a soft organ stop made of metal or wood, usually in the pedals.


Tragedy of the commons

The tragedy of the commons was an article published by Garrett Hardin in the journal "Science" in 1968. It describes a problem where many people with their own ideas can make something they all share worse, even if no one wants to. For example, even if no one wants to pollute water because that makes it unhealthy, it can still end up like that because so many want to use the water for their own reasons, like washing and throwing away rubbish. Each person thinks that their small bit of pollution of the water is too small to affect the quality of the water, but because there are many people the total effect ends up making the water too polluted for mostly anybody to use for drinking or even washing. This may occur in slums and other overcrowded places like refugee camps.

The idea was not Hardin's, but a person named William Forster Lloyd who wrote about it in 1833. In those days herders often grazed cows on common land. Lloyd pointed out that each cow added benefit to its owner but damaged the land overall for all herders by overgrazing.

The tragedy of the commons is often used in modern debates on ecology and externality. It is also a topic in game theory.

Data Base Task Group

The Data Base Task Group (DBTG) was a working group founded in 1965 by the "Cobol Committee", formerly "Programming Language Committee", of the "Conference of Data Systems Language" (CODASYL).

In April 1971, The DBTG published a report containing specifications of a "Data Manipulation Language" (DML) and a "Data Definition Language" (DDL) for standardization of network database models. The first DBTG proposals had already been published in 1969. The specification was subsequently modified and developed in various committees and published in other reports in 1973 and 1978. The specification is often referred to as the DBTG database model or the CODASYL database model. As well as the data model, many basic concepts of database terminology were introduced by this group, notably the concepts of schema and subschema.


David Popper

David Popper (born Prague, 16 June 1843; died Baden, Austria, 7 August 1913) was a Bohemian cellist and composer. He composed many works for the cello which today are performed by cellists all over the world.

Popper was born in the old Jewish part of Prague. His father was a Cantor in two synagogues. When he was three years old he was imitating his father’s singing. He learned the violin when he was six and, at the age of twelve, he got a place to study music at the Prague Conservatory, but he had to learn the cello. His cello teacher was Julius Goltermann. His first job was as cellist to the Prince of Hohenzollern who soon gave him the title “Kammervirtuoso”. He was only 21 when he played a difficult concerto by Robert Volkmann. The conductor, Hans von Bülow, was very impressed and so were the critics. He gave many concerts in Vienna and became very famous. He started to travel around Europe, visiting England and Russia. He had a lot of energy and was able to compose a lot while travelling. He composed many short cello pieces. His "Elfentanz" (Dance of the Elves) and "Spinning Song" were especially popular with the audiences.

In 1886 Popper married for the second time. In the same year he took up a job at the Royal Hungarian Academy of Music in Budapest. He was a famous teacher and charged a high fee for lessons. He formed a string quartet with three other musicians including the violinist Jenő Hubay. Hubay and Popper often played piano trios with Johannes Brahms.

Popper made a long visit to England and Scotland where he was described as the world’s greatest cellist by many people including George Bernard Shaw. When he returned to Prague he played with Béla Bartók who was only 19 years old and not yet famous. He was also impressed when he heard the young Pablo Casals, although he did not agree with his technique.

Popper had one son who died of tuberculosis in 1911. Two years later Popper slipped on an icy pavement. He was never able to use his right arm again. He died the next summer of a heart attack.

Popper composed a very large number of cello pieces, many of which are short pieces suitable for encores at a recital. One of the most popular (and not too difficult) is the "Gavotte in D major". He composed a "Requiem" for three cellos and orchestra, and he wrote four cello concertos. However, his most important work for cellists is a collection of studies called "Hochschule des Violoncellspiels" ("High School of Cello Playing"). This book contains 40 etudes, or musical exercises to develop technique, and is widely used today by cello students to improve their playing.


Herbert Backe

Herbert Backe (1 May 1896 – 6 April 1947) was a German politician and war criminal.

He was born in Batumi, Georgia. He worked in the Third Reich government and was made Minister of Food in May 1942 and Minister of Agriculture in April 1944. He had that job in the short-lived Cabinet of Admiral Karl Dönitz in the last days of World War II, from late April to May 1945, as the political request of Adolf Hitler. During the war, Alfred Rosenberg said that Backe should become the leader of the Ukraine Reichskommissariat (Nazi government in the Ukraine).

He was one of the people who planned and made happen the Hunger Plan - a plan to starve to death tens of millions of Slavic people in order to make sure there was enough food available for the German people and military.

He was taken prisoner by the Allies after the war, he was to be tried in the Ministries Trial, but he killed himself by hanging in his cell at Nuremberg on 6 April 1947.


Joseph Berchtold

Joseph Berchtold (March 6, 1897 in Ingolstadt – August 23, 1962 in Herrsching am Ammersee), a former salesman who sold office products, became Reichsführer SS after Julius Schreck in 1926.

Berchtold was in the World War I and had the rank of second lieutenant at the end of the war. In 1920 he joined the NSDAP and in 1922 also the SA. He was thought to be better than Julius Schreck, but was still not able to keep the people who started the party under control. After a lot of arguing he resigned in 1927 and was replaced by his deputy, Erhard Heiden.

During Nazi Germany he was a councillor of Munich from 1934 to 1945, and a member of the Reichstag from 1936 to 1945.

Mud volcano

A mud volcano or mud dome is a kind of volcano that is made by liquids and gases from the earth. There are many different ways that mud volcanoes can be made. Temperatures in a mud volcano are much cooler than that of a regular volcano. The biggest mud volcanoes are 10 kilometers in diameter and can be as tall as 700 meters. Most of the gases given off by mud volcanoes are methane. Other gases given off include carbon dioxide and methane. They usually spit out liquids with solids in the liquids. An example of this would be water with salt or acids in the water.

A mud volcano is usually made by mud diapir that breaks out of the surface of the Earth or on the ocean bottom. Temperatures in mud volcanoes can be as low as the freezing point. 

Mud volcanoes are often linked with places where petroleum gathers and around areas of tectonic subduction. They can also be linked with orogenic belts where hydrocarbon gases usually erupt. They are also often linked with lava volcanoes as well. However, instead of spitting out magma, mud volcanoes spit out gases like methane and carbon dioxide.

Around 1,100 mud volcanoes have been found on land and in shallow water. People think that more than 10,000 mud volcanoes may exist on continental slopes and abyssal plains.

There are many features of mud volcanoes. One of these features is the gryphon, which is a steep, short cone that gives off mud. Another feature is the mud cone, which is a tall cone that makes mud and small pieces of rock. The scoria cone is a cone that is made when deposits of mud are heated up and the salse, which are pools of water that leak gases out of them. Mud volcanoes have many other features, but most of these are notable.

Most of the things that mud volcanoes spit out happen during volcanic eruptions. Other eruptions have been known to happen during the time when a volcano is dormant or sleeping.

There are very few mud volcanoes in Europe, but quite a few are on the Taman Peninsula of Russia and the Kerch Peninsula in the southeastern part of Ukraine. In Italy, many mud volcanoes are near the Apennines and in Sicily. Also in Europe are the Berca Mud Volcanoes, near Berca in Buzău County, Romania. Many mud volcanoes are by the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. Movement from tectonic plates have made areas of mod volcanoes that spit out hydrocarbons and methane. Some of the tallest mud volcanoes are in Azerbaijan. Mud volcanoes are also in Iran and Pakistan in the Makran mountain range.

China has a lot of mud volcanoes in the Xinjiang province. There are two active mud volcanoes in the southern part of Taiwan. The island of Baratang, which is part of the Great Andaman group of islands in the Andaman Islands, Indian Ocean also have a few active mud volcanoes.

People think that 300 of the mud volcanoes out of the 700 mud volcanoes on Earth are in the eastern part of Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea. In 2001, one mud volcano about 15 kilometers away from Baku was in the world news when it suddenly started spitting out flames 15 meters high.



Black smoker

A black smoker is a kind of hydrothermal vent that can be found on the ocean floor. It is a crack in the planet's surface from which geothermally heated water comes out. Hydrothermal vents are commonly found near volcanically active places, areas where tectonic plates are moving apart, ocean basins, and hotspots.

Hydrothermal vents are common on earth because it is both geologically active and has large amounts of water on its surface and within its crust. Common land types include hot springs, fumaroles and geysers. The most famous hydrothermal vent system on land is probably within Yellowstone National Park in the United States. Under the sea, hydrothermal vents may form features called "black smokers".

Relative to the majority of the deep sea, the areas around submarine hydrothermal vents are biologically more productive, often hosting complex communities fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids. Chemosynthetic archaea form the base of the food chain, supporting diverse organisms, including giant tube worms, clams, limpets and shrimp.
Active hydrothermal vents are believed to exist on Jupiter's moon Europa, and ancient hydrothermal vents have been speculated to exist on Mars.


Chinese zodiac

The Chinese zodiac is a mathematical cycle of 12 animals. Each animal represents one year. People are associated with the zodiac animal for the year that they are born.

List of tallest buildings in Chicago

This is a list of the tallest buildings in Chicago.



Trump International Hotel and Tower

The Trump International Hotel and Tower is a skyscraper in Chicago, United States. It is 415 meters (1,362 feet) tall and has 96 floors. It was built in 2009 and is one of the tallest buildings in the world. It is the third largest skyscraper in the USA (behind the One World Trade Center and the Willis Tower). It is the second tallest tower in Chicago.

The tower is at 401 North Wabash Avenue in the River North Gallery District, part of the Near North Side community area of Chicago. The building is on the site that used to be the "Chicago Sun-Times" building, one of the city's two major newspapers. It is on the north side of the Chicago River just west of the Wrigley Building and the Michigan Avenue Bridge, and just east of Marina City and 330 North Wabash.

The Trump International Hotel and Tower rises from the building's main entrance on Wabash Avenue to the tip of the architectural spire. Upon its completion in 2009, the building became the seventh-tallest building in the world, behind the Jin Mao Tower in Shanghai, People's Republic of China. 

On November 17, 2009, however, the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), which creates the rankings of the tallest skyscrapers in the world based on various criteria, changed its standard for measuring a building's height. As the Trump International Hotel and Tower has a riverwalk entrance and pedestrian level below the building's Wabash Avenue entrance, the skyscraper's official height was recalculated as without a physical addition to the structure. This made the tower the sixth-tallest building in the world, passing the Jin Mao Tower by . 

In January 2010, the building moved back to its position as seventh-tallest with the opening of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.

According to Donald Trump, he received approval for a sign from Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley's administration in 2009, but renegotiated with Mayor Rahm Emanuel's administration. In October 2013, Trump received approval to put a stainless steel letters back-lit with white LED lighting spelling out TRUMP on the 16th floor of the building. He made his plans for the sign public in February 2014. The five letters span a width of about , making the final approved version about , according to some sourcesrather than the originally proposed size. The sign is about above ground level.

Crews began hanging the sign in May 2014. When "Chicago Tribune" architecture critic Kamin warned Trump that his review of the sign would be unfavorable, Trump responded "As time passes, it'll be like the Hollywood Sign"; architect Adrian Smith was against the sign saying "Just for the record, I had nothing to do with this sign!"

The sign was controversial as several Chicagoans and local politicians criticized Trump's sign. As a result, then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel created a study to change the rules of future sign-building on skyscrapers in the city.

In the aftermath of the January 6 United States Capitol attack, city alderman Gilbert Villegas proposed a new law that would prevent any renewal of sign permits to persons convicted of "treason, sedition or subversive activities", specifically targeting the sign.

Color of the day (police)

The color of the day is a signal used by undercover officers of some big city police departments in the USA. It is used to identify undercover officers. It is mostly known to be used by the New York City Police Department (NYPD), the NYPD Transit Bureau (which was called the "New York City Transit Police") and the NYPD Housing Bureau (which was called the "New York City Housing Authority Police Department") and other law enforcement agencies when they are at work in New York City. An undercover police officer will wear a headband, wristband or other piece of clothing in the same color as the "color of the day"; this color is told to officers at the precinct before they start work. The system is for officer safety and first started during the violence of 1970s and 1980s New York City. The color of the day system is not known by most of the public but it is written about a lot by newspapers, and by writers and can sometimes be seen on episodes of television shows such as NYPD Blue and recently .

New York City is a very large metropolitan city with a population of over 8,310,000 people with over 18,800,000 people living in the area around it. An extra 500,000 people enter the city during a weekday. It has many police and law enforcement officers such as; the NYPD, the (MTA) Police (that used to be called the Metro North Commuter Railroad Police), the Port Authority Police, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and U.S. Customs and others. The color of the day system is about officer safety. With so many armed officers in the city, undercover police officers need to have an easy to use system in place so that other armed officers know that they are there and do not shoot them when they use their guns. The system is also used so that a uniformed officer will not disturb a person who is really an undercover police officer who is acting as a homeless person so that criminals will rob him.

The NYPD Street Crimes Unit started in 1971. During the late 1970s, the 1980s and early 1990s, New York City had a lot more crime than it does today. Undercover officers were asked to go into the subways in plain-clothes or dressed as a homeless person to hide the fact that they were police. Many of these officers were black and had a fear that as they looked like civilian homeless people that uniformed officers would think that they were criminals if they used their guns. Many of these officers would dress and pretend to be drunk homeless people or as victims in order to catch muggers who were attacking them due to being unable to help themselves. The color of the day system was made to make these officers fear this less and was used by all undercover police officers. At the beginning headbands were given out to each street crime unit member, that were in the color of the day: beginning the use of the color of the day system. Later this included wristbands and today's officers often dress in the color: i.e.: T-shirts, shoes, and hats.

The color of the day recognition system is written about by authors and people who study the police in schools but it is not often known about by most people in New York. Books that talk about it are Roger Abell's "The Black Shields" (a discussion of African American policing in New York), Greg Faliis' "Just the Facts Ma'am", and Leslie Glass' novel, "A Killing Gift".




Titanoboa

Titanoboa cerrejonensis is the largest known snake. Now extinct, the snake was a relative of the "anaconda" and the "boa constrictor". It was about 43 feet long (13 m), and weighed over a ton (about 1135 kg or 2,500 pounds). The snake lived in the Palaeocene epoch, about 58 million years ago. It ate crocodiles.

The fossil was found in an open-cast coal mine in Colombia, in 2009. Plant fossils at the site proved the climate at the time was a tropical rainforest. The site was in the Cerrejón Formation in La Guajira, Colombia. Other large reptile fossils have been found at this site.

Researchers found three skulls of the snake in 2002. A life-size replica is on view at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington D.C. It was sent on a world tour to be shown at various museums.

"Titanoboa" lived in the first recorded tropical forest in South America. It shared the ecosystem with large Crocodylomorpha and large turtles. The paleogeography of the late Paleocene was a sheltered paralic (coastal) swamp, with an open connection to the proto-Caribbean in the north. In this environment tropical aquatic ferns like "Salvinia" flourished. The ferns were found as fossils in the Bogotá Formation and the Palermo Formation.

Republic of Taiwan (1895)

The Republic of Taiwan was a short-lived republic on the island of Taiwan. It is also called in ; which means "Democratic State of Taiwan". In English it was also called the: Formosan Republic, Taiwan Republic and the Republic of Formosa.

The Republic of Taiwan was formed in 1895. It did not last for very long. The Treaty of Shimonoseki which ended the war between the Qing Dynasty of China and the Empire of Japan, gave Taiwan to the Japanese. The republic began when the Chinese left in May, 1895, and ended when the Japanese soldiers arrived in October, 1896. Some historians say it was the first republic in Asia, but there was one earlier, the , which had been started in 1777.

The republic was started by a group of high officials and local people who still supported the Qing. They wanted to stop the Japanese take over of Taiwan. On May 24, 1895 the new republic sent a copy of its declaration of independence to all the embassies on Taiwan. The next day the new government held an independence ceremony. The Republic of Taiwan made their own stamps. They also printed their own paper money, which is now very hard to find.

They were always loyal to the Qing, and said that the Republic would be part of the Qing state. The first president of the Republic of Taiwan was the old governor, Tang Ching-sung, who served from May 25, 1895 to June 5, 1895. The second president was Liu Yung-fu, June 5, 1895 – October 21, 1896.

When the Japanese soldiers invaded Taiwan there was a lot of fighting. They quickly defeated the new republic. Most of the republic's official quickly left the island.

The modern Taiwan independence groups want to start a new Republic of Taiwan. They say that there is no connection between them and the 1895 Republic. The first Republic of Taiwan was loyal to China, but the new Republic of Taiwan would be started to be independent of China.

Adjutant

An Adjutant is a military rank in some armies. Adjutants support the Officers.

The word Adjutant is first time used in the French army. Adjutants worked there for the Majors as an assistant.

Freikorps

The word Freikorps (German for "Free Corps") was first used for voluntary armies in Germany. After World War I the term was used for paramilitary units. The Freikorps got famous at the time of the Weimar Republic to fight in some towns against Communism.

The first freikorps were started by Frederick II of Prussia in the eighteenth century during the Seven Years' War. Other freikorps were started during the Napoleonic Wars and were commanded by people such as Ferdinand von Schill and later Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von Lützow. The freikorps were thought to be not reliable by regular armies and were mostly used as guards and for minor duties.

The meaning of the word changed over time. After 1918, the word was used for the paramilitary organizations that were started in Germany by soldiers who came home after losing World War I. They were the main paramilitary groups during that time. Many of these returning soldiers were not able to return to a normal life, and joined a Freikorps to again be a part of a military structure. Others were angry at losing the war and joined to fight against Communists or get revenge. They were liked and supported by Minister of Defence Gustav Noske, a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, who used them to stop the German Revolution and the Marxist Spartacist League, and also to murder Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg on 15 January 1919. They were also used to defeat the Bavarian Soviet Republic in 1919.

In 1920, Adolf Hitler had started his political work as the leader of the very small and unknown German Workers Party (that was soon called the National Socialist German Workers Party, NSDAP (or Nazi Party)) in Munich. Many people who would join this party had been in the Freikorps, including Ernst Röhm, future leader of the Sturmabteilung, or SA, and Rudolf Höß, the future Commander of the Auschwitz concentration camp.

Hermann Ehrhardt, who started the Marinebrigade Ehrhardt, and his deputy Commander, Eberhard Kautter, did not want to help Hitler and Erich von Ludendorff in the Beer Hall Putsch.

Freikorps leaders gave their old battle flags to Hitler's SA and SS on Nov 9, 1933 in a very big ceremony. Historian Robert Waite said that Hitler had many problems with the Freikorps. Many of the Friekorps had joined the SA, so when the Night of the Long Knives happened, they were targets for being murdered or arrested and this was also done to Ehrhardt and to Röhm. Waite also says that in Hitler's 'Rohm Purge' speech to the Reichstag on July 13, 1934, that Hitler said that the Freikorps were enemies of Germany.

In 1939, in the Polish September Campaign, "Freikorps Ebbinghaus", was started to work behind the frontlines. It was not very good at this work and was sent to fight as an army unit but was not good at this either and was ended in less than one year.

Recognition signal

A recognition signal is a signal where a person, a ship, an airplane or something else is recognized. They can be used during war or can be used to help the police recognize each other during undercover operations. It can also be used in biology to signal that a molecule or chemical is to be bound to another molecule.

These signals are often used to recognize friends and enemies in a war. For military use these signals often use colored lights or the International marine signal flags

Other uses of the signal include the police who sometimes use a recognition signal so that officers in uniform can recognize officers in normal clothing (undercover). The NYPD often use headbands, wristbands or colored clothing as recognition signals which are known as the "color of the day".

A recognition signal is also a chemical signal used in biology to signal the end of a section of DNA or RNA during gene duplication in cells.



New York City Police Department

The New York City Police Department (NYPD), started in 1844, is the largest police force in the United States. There are currently 37,838 Uniformed Police Personnel, 4,500 Auxiliary Police Personnel and 5,000 School Safety Agents. It is the police force that serves the five boroughs of New York City. The NYPD was one of the first "modern" style police departments in the United States with the Boston Police Department. The NYPD uses a color of the day to allow uniformed officers to recognize undercover officers to prevent accidental shootings.

The NYPD’s street crime unit (motto: "We Own The Night") was a 300+ member plain clothes unit for reducing crime that became well known after the 1999 killing of Amadou Diallo. The four officers involved in the shooting were all members of the street crime unit. The unit was ended in 2002 because of the Diallo shooting. The unit's last leader was Inspector Bruce H. Smolka, who was later made Assistant Chief. The street crime unit has been replaced by the local precincts Anti-Crime Units.
All of the officers involved in the shooting were found not guilty of the criminal charges in a long trial that took place in Albany after a successful request to change the location of the trial from the Bronx, where the shooting happened.

The street crime unit was started in 1971 and had a long history of success in catching armed criminals on NYC streets. The establishment of the street crime unit led to the development of the color of the day undercover officer recognition system.


Undercover

Being undercover means that a person is wearing normal clothing and is hiding their identity from people. It is often used by police officers when they are investigating crimes or criminals. It is done to gain trust and also possibly to gather evidence. It is not the same as a police officer who is wearing normal clothing (a plain-clothes officer) but who is not hiding their real name and that they are a police officer.

Proboscis monkey

The proboscis monkey ("Nasalis larvatus") is found only on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. 

They live in mangrove forests, and also lowland rainforests. It depends on the mangroves near river edges for resting and sleeping. They avoid deforested areas and avoid human settlements.

The proboscis monkey eats mainly fruit and leaves. It also eats flowers, seeds and insects to a lesser extent. At least 55 different plant species are eaten. Young leaves are preferred over mature leaves and unripe fruits are preferred over ripe fruit. Being a seasonal eater, the proboscis monkey eats mostly fruit from January to May and mostly leaves from June to December. Groups usually sleep in adjacent trees. Monkeys tend to sleep near rivers, if they are nearby. Proboscis monkeys will start the day foraging and then rest further inland. Proboscis monkeys' daily activities consist of resting, traveling, feeding and keeping vigilant.

Christmas Island pipistrelle

The Christmas Island pipistrelle ("Pipistrellus murrayi") was a species of bat in the Vespertilionidae family. Biologists believe the bat became extinct on 27 August 2009.

It was a small bat (it weighed ), and lived only on Christmas Island, Australia. It was thought to be the same as the "Pipistrellus tenuis", but research on the bat's baculum (a penis bone) showed that "Pipistrellus murrayi" was a different species.

The numbers of Christmas Island Pipistrelle bats had dropped a lot in the last 20 years. It had once been seen all over the island, including in the Settlement. It went from at least 80% of its living range, and its numbers had dropped more than 90% since 1994. Research into the number of bats in January 2009, shows there were only about 20 bats left. The only known group resting place had only four bats. The last bat call was heard on 26 August 2009.

Scientists do not know why the Christmas Island Pipistrelle's numbers dropped. Several possible threats may have been:

A number of animals brought to Christmas Island could be the problem:

Early in 2009, the Australian Minister for the Environment, Peter Garrett, stopped scientists from trying to set up a captive breeding program. He said that the bats were too hard to catch, and no one knew how to keep them alive in cages. Instead, he announced a program to breed a similar bat in the Northern Territory of Australia. Scientists would learn about caring and breeding bats, then use this information to save the Christmas Island Pipistrelle. Other scientists had said this would take too long, and the bats would become extinct. Scientists believed that by June 2009 there were only four of the bats left in the world. In July 2009, the Australian Government changed its earlier decision and said that it would try to capture the last of the bats and use them to try and breed more bats in captivity. During August and September 2009 scientists searched for the remaining bats to catch them and protect them. At the end of August only one bat had been heard. Scientists tried to catch this bat, but it has not been heard from since the night of 26 August. It is now believed that the bat is extinct. This may be one of the few times that the extinction of a species in the wild can be known to the exact day. Scientists will continue to search for the bat, but there has been no signs of the bat since.

Order theory

Order theory is a field of mathematics. It concerns itself with being able to compare different elements of a set. Given a binary relation it is then possible to put all the elements of the set in a certain order. It is also possible to say that a certain element "comes before" another one, for that relation. Another way to say this is to say that one of the two is "smaller than" the other.

For a specific set to be ordered it must be:

"reflexive: "each element of the set is within a relation with itself.

"anti-symmetric:" if A and B are in relation, and B is also in a relation with A, then A must be equal to B.

"transitive: "if A and B in a relation, and B is in a relation with C, then A and C must be in a relation.

Hermann Wilhelm Göring (12 January 1893 in Rosenheim, Upper Bavaria, Bavaria, Germany – 15 October 1946 in Nuremberg, Bavaria, Germany) was a war criminal, German politician and military leader of Germany. As second in command after Hitler, he was one of the most powerful leaders of the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Between 1932 and 1945, he was President of the German Reichstag and also a minister of the Third Reich, under Adolf Hitler. In the Second World War, he was the Commander-in-Chief of the German air force. Göring was responsible for the creation of the concentration camps and the Gestapo, the Nazi secret police, which he handed over to SS chief Heinrich Himmler. In 1941, he gave Reinhard Heydrich the order to arrange the Final Solution to kill millions of Jews.

Göring was one of the 25 people charged at the Nuremberg Trials. The court decided he was guilty. The judgment on 1 October 1946 said that he was to be hanged, but he killed himself by swallowing a tablet of cyanide a few hours before he could be executed.

Hermann Göring, son of Ernst Heinrich Göring and Franziska Göring (born Tiefenbrunn), was born in Rosenheim, Bavaria in 1893. Göring's father was a judge. The German chancellor Otto von Bismarck made Ernst Göring the first "Reichskommissar" (Governor-General) of "South West Africa" (today: Namibia), in 1885.

Hermann Göring had two brothers, Albert Göring and Karl Ernst Göring, and two sisters, Olga Therese Sophie Göring and Paula Elisabeth Rosa Göring.

He spent the first three years of his life at the home of a friend of his mother, because Göring's father was in Namibia. From 1901, he lived at his godfather Hermann von Epenstein mansion. Hermann's mother had an affair (a romantic relationship with someone other than her husband) with von Epenstein. He attended the grammar schools in Fürth and Ansbach. In the games he played as a child, the story was always about war.

In 1905, he went to a military school in Karlsruhe. He got his Abitur, and an officer exam, in 1912. He then went to the Bavarian Prinz Wilhelm Regiment (112th Infantry) in Mulhouse.

When the First World War started, Göring had the rank of Lieutenant. He had served in the infantry. In 1915, because of his rheumatism, he had to go to a hospital. His friend, Bruno Loerzer, got him to join the air force. In France, he flew as an observer, a person who looked for targets and enemy planes. Because of this, he was awarded the Iron Cross First Class in 1915. In 1916, he was trained to fly a plane. On 14 March 1916, he shot down his first bomber. In 1917, he became the leader of the 27 Flying Group. In 1918, after he shot his 19 plane, he was awarded the Pour le Mérite (also called "The Blue Max"). This was the highest air force award in Germany. After the death of Manfred von Richthofen, he became the leader of the flying group "The Red Baron".

Between 1919 and 1921, Göring worked as a stunt pilot in Scandinavia. In November 1922, he met Adolf Hitler and later became a member of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP). Göring married Carin in Stockholm on 3 February 1923. In 1923 he was leading the SA ("Oberste SA-Führer"), and he took part in the Beer Hall Putsch and was wounded. After this, he went to Austria. Because of pain, a doctor injected him with morphine but he became dependent on it. Between 1925 and 1926, he had two treatments in Sweden at the Långbro mental hospital. He came back to Germany in 1927. In 1928, he became a member of the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic. He was a member of the Reichstag until the end of the Second World War. In 1932, the NSDAP became the most powerful party of the Reichstag. Göring then became president of the Reichstag.

When Hitler became chancellor of the Weimar Germany in 1933, he made Göring a minister of the Reich without a specific area of responsibility. This means that he was not the head of a ministry. In April 1933, he was made minister president of Prussia. Then, on 30 August 1933, he was made a General by Paul von Hindenburg. Between 1934 and 1935 he became minister of several agencies. His wife had died in 1931, and in 1935 he married Emmy Sonnemann in Berlin. In 1936, he sent the German Condor Legion to Spain to help Francisco Franco. After the Kristallnacht in 1938, he was in charge of removing Jewish businessmen from the German economic system. During Second World War, his biggest defeat was the loss of the air battle against Great Britain. Hitler named Göring to be his successor if he died in 1939. 

In 1940, he was made Reichsmarschall (Marshal of the Empire) by Nazi leader, Adolf Hitler. In 1941, Göring ordered Heydrich to make a plan for the Holocaust. In 1942, he gave Fritz Sauckel the order to use the Russian population for industry-work. In 1943, Göring had an expensive birthday party for his 50 birthday. On 20 April 1945, he left Hitler's birthday party and went to Berchtesgaden. He told Hitler that he had very important things to do in south Germany. From Berchtesgaden, Göring sent a telegram to Hitler in Berlin. In the telegram Göring asked about taking over the affairs of state. Towards the end of the war, after the telegram, he started to talk with the Allies. Because of this, Hitler wanted to put Göring in prison. Göring then went to the Americans.

On 29 April 1945 Hitler removed Göring from all his offices, stripped him off his party membership and ordered his arrest. He wrote this down in his testament.

Göring surrendered in Bavaria on 9 May 1945. The Nuremberg Trials started on 20 November 1945. On 18 March 1946, Göring was questioned by the Allies. After this, he was imprisoned in Nuremberg. He was the third-highest-ranking Nazi official tried at Nuremberg. Only Reich President (former "Großadmiral") Karl Dönitz and former Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess had higher ranks than Göring. The judges decided he was guilty. Because of this on 1 October 1946 the court reached a verdict that he was to be hanged. One day before he was to be hanged, he committed suicide by taking a tablet of cyanide. It is not known how Göring got the cyanide or how long he hid it but there was a claim that he was given it by an American soldier who was in love with a German woman who was in touch with him. It is not known if this is the truth. He was infamous for his quote "Of course the people don't want war. But after all it's the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it's always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it's a democracy, a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship."

Varuna completes one rotation in about 3.17 hours (or 6.34 hours, depending on whether the light curve is single or double-peaked). Given the fast rotation, which is not common for objects so big, Varuna is thought to be a stretched spheroid, with a density around 1g/cm³ (close to the density of water).

The surface of Varuna is somewhat red and small amounts of water ice have been found on its surface.


Alfred Rosenberg

Alfred Ernst Rosenberg (Born ; 12th January 1893 in Tallinn,Russia (Today Estonia)/Died ; 16th October 1946 in Nuremberg,Bavaria,Germany) was a German political philosopher from Baltic German origin.

Maximum Ride

Maximum Ride is a young adult science fiction/fantasy series written by the award-winning American author, James Patterson, starting from April 19, 2005 and continuing to the present. Right now, there are six titles in the series: 
Each of the novels in the series has reached #1 on the New York Times Best Seller list.

The series focuses on six kids who are 98% human and 2% avian, Max, Fang, Iggy, Nudge, Gasman and Angel (also known as the Flock) who must escape from evil mad scientists from "The School". They are being hunted down by Erasers who are a human-wolf mix. The Flock work towards protecting the world from being ruled by strange figures, who have also shown an interest in their capture.

In January 2007 it was announced that a movie based on the "Maximum Ride" series would be made. The producer of it was Avi Arad, one of the producers of Spider-Man, X-Men and other Marvel movies. In an interview with James Patterson, it was told Arad had already planned out the first movie based on the series. On August 7, 2008, it was announced that Columbia Pictures bought the screen rights to the franchise, and that Don Payne would write the screenplay. The first "Maximum Ride" movie released in 2016. However, when they were making the film in 2016, the writers of its screenplay were changed to Angelique Hanus and Jesse Spears.

Crab-eating Macaque

The crab-eating macaque ("Macaca fascicularis") is a monkey. It is mostly native to Southeast Asia. It is also called the cynomolgus monkey, Philippine monkey, and the long-tailed macaque.

In 2018, scientists in China cloned the crab-eating macaque. They named the two baby monkeys Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua.

Juan Carlos I of Spain

Juan Carlos I (, full name: Juan Carlos Alfonso Víctor María de Borbón y Borbón-Dos Sicilias, born 5 January 1938) is a member of the Spanish royal family. He was the King of Spain from 1975 until his abdication in 2014. In Spain, since his abdication, Juan Carlos has usually been referred to as the ('King Emeritus'). 

During most of his 39-year reign, he was very popular. When he became king in 1975, he transformed Spain from dictatorship to democracy this made people consider him the champion of democracy. He was a popular king and was considered Spain's hero and savoir. He ruled effectively and that the Spanish people loved him. He made Spain more modern and improved relations with many countries. The Spaniards would always experience prosperity.

However in 2012, Juan Carlos' popularity started to decline as posted a photo of him hunting with an elephant in Bostwana. During this time, many Spaniards were struggling to make ends meet and when Juan Carlos posted this photo, his popularity started to decline. He also had a sex relationship with Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, his former mistress. One of the Spanish royal family members was also involved in a crime. All of this made him unpopular and he eventually abdicated the throne two years later in 2014 in favor of his son, Crown Prince Felipe who became king Felipe VI. In 2020, Juan Carlos fled the country and is now living in Abu Dhabi in the UAE.

German National People's Party

The German National People's Party (German: "Deutschnationale Volkspartei" and short: "DNVP") was national-conservative party of the time of the Weimar Republic and the Third Reich. This party was founded in 1918, after World War I. In June 1933, the DNVP merged with the NSDAP.


Howler monkey

Howler monkeys, genus "Alouatta", are one of the largest New World monkeys. There are 15 species. They are native to South and Central American forests.

These monkeys are famous for their loud howls, which can travel three miles (4.8 km) through dense forest. They are the loudest monkey and may be the loudest land animal. Group males call at dawn and dusk, and at times during the day. The function of howling may relate to intergroup spacing and territory protection.

These social primates live high in the trees (the canopy) of the rain forests of Central America, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Brazil, northern Argentina, and Bolivia. Howlers have a life span of about 20 years. They are in decline due to a loss of habitat.

Chronic

In medicine a chronic disease or condition is one that takes a long time to heal (or go away), or one that comes again. Many chronic diseases require special treatment, as this has to be done for a long time. A chronic disease can even last for a lifetime.

Wristband

A wristband is a piece of clothing, plastic, metal or other material that is worn around the wrist of a person. There are different types of wristband such as those on watches and on the ends of the sleeves of a piece of clothing. Other types are the awareness bands and security bands used for music concerts and school dances.

There are many different types of wristband. Watches have wristbands that are often made of metal, plastic or leather. A metal wristband on a watch is often called a bracelet. A plastic or leather wristband on a watch is often called a strap.

Many people wear wristbands when they exercise or play sports to absorb sweat.

Hand Sweatbands

In 2009 a new Sweatband was invented, primarily designed for runners, called a s"Q"oosh band. This groundbreaking design completely changed the look of sweatbands. Worn on the hand to precisely wipe sweat from the eyes and face, these bands join moisture wicking material to stretch terry cloth. s"Q"oosh brands revolutionized the old-fashioned sweatband market with a new favorite for runners in the 21st century. Similarly designed hand-sweatbands started appearing on the market in 2012.

Charities and awareness organizations often make wristbands that are sold to people so that the money can help people who are sick or need other help, and to help other people learn about their charity or awareness organization. Some bands are those made for; Make Poverty History, Anti-bullying, disease awareness charities and to help people learn about religions (such as the "Jesus Loves Me" band). These bands are often made of plastic or silicone. The making of some of these bands has been in the news as some were made in sweatshops in China and poor countries. This is said to be very bad because these wristbands are made to help people and charities and by being made in these sweatshops they have hurt the people making them because these places are often not safe, and the people working in them do not get paid much money for work they do.

Awareness wristbands were first started by the Lance Armstrong charity Livestrong (see "Other websites") in 2003.

Some of these wristbands are copied by criminals and sold to people without the money going to the organization they are trying to help.

Some awareness bands:

Wristbands are often used at music events like concerts and sports event to show that the person wearing them has paid to be there. Some events let people leave and return during the event. Security wristbands allow the person to come back in to the event after they have given their ticket to the staff the first time they entered.

Sometimes safety wristbands have been used to give to both a parent and child to make sure that only the parent can take the child home from an event. Both of their wristbands have the same number on them and this stops someone else from taking the child.

Hospitals also use wristbands on patients so that they know who they are because patients do not carry identification with them when they are in the hospital.<ref>

Doutzen Kroes

Doutzen Kroes (Pronounced "Dow-tsen Croos") (born 23 January 1985 in Eastermar, Friesland) is a Dutch-Frisian model who has become internationally famous. In the Netherlands she is not only famous as a model, but also for her support for the Frisian language which is her first language. She is married and has two children.

After she had finished school Doutzen sent a few holiday photos to a model agency "Paparazzi" in Amsterdam. She hoped she would be able to earn a little extra money. To her amazement she was so successful that in two years she had become a top model.

In 2005, Kroes was selected as "Model of The Year" on Vogue.com by readers and was featured as a supermodel on the cover of the May 2007 issue. Along with several of these models, she appeared in the 2008 Pirelli calendar.

Doutzen appears in shows for Versace and Dolce & Gabbana and has a contract with the cosmetic firm L'Oréal. This contract made her the highest paid Dutch model ever. In November 2007 she became one of Victoria's Secret angels. 

Doutzen’s first language is Frisian. She is very active in the campaign "Praat mar Frysk" ("Let’s speak Frisian") which helps to make the Frisian language popular. She earned a Frisian Press Prize for this work in December 2007.

In 2007 she was the 13th highest paid model in the world, having earned 3,8 million euro.

On 28 April 2008, Madame Tussauds added a wax model of Doutzen to the exhibition. The skirt she is wearing is said to be her favourite skirt. It is designed by Roberto Cavalli.

Doutzen spends most of her time in her apartment in New York.

In 2010 she married Sunnery James a DJ. Their first child, Phyllon, was born in January 2011. Their second child, a girl, was born in 2014.


Sweatshop

A sweatshop : is a place where people work, that is very crowded, where the work is very hard and the place is not safe to work in. Many sweatshops are in poor countries but sweatshops are also found in rich countries, where they often have people who are new to the country working in them, or people who are not legal residents. The amount of money people are paid in sweatshops is lower than the amount paid to workers in a richer country, but is often higher than the worker would earn in their old jobs on farms, or working in manual labour. Children may also work in sweatshops. People in sweatshops often make clothes and shoes. Awareness wristbands for charities have also been made by sweatshops.






Pirelli calendar

The Pirelli Calendar is a calendar (publication showing dates for the year) published by Pirelli company's UK subsidiary.

It started in 1964 and is now very famous because only a few calendars are published each year, and these are given to important people (VIPs) and Pirelli customers. The calendars have photographs of female models including nudes.

After 1974 publication of the calendar was stopped because there was not enough money after the oil crisis. Ten years later it was started again and has been published regularly ever since. Many famous models have been photographed for the calendar including: Sienna Miller, Naomi Campbell, Gisele Bündchen, Sonny Freeman Drane, Kate Moss, Cindy Crawford, Selma Blair, Lauren Bush, Elsa Benitez, Laetitia Casta, Rachael Leigh Cook, Milla Jovovich, Doutzen Kroes, Heidi Klum, Sophia Loren, Penélope Cruz, Brittany Murphy, Amy Smart, Julia Stiles, Karolina Kurkova, Caroline Trentini, Raica Oliveira, Adriana Lima, Alessandra Ambrosio, Bridget Moynahan, Shannyn Sossamon, Mena Suvari, Monet Mazur, Aurelie Claudel, Fernanda Tavares, Isabeli Fontana, Frankie Rayder, Angela Lindvall, Hilary Swank and Yamila Díaz.


Bullying

Bullying is hurting or threatening people who seem weak. The people who bully other people are called bullies. Anybody can be bullied, even a group of people. There are many different kinds of bullying. Bullying does not always mean hitting people. It can also be things that people say or do.

Bullying includes when people see what happens, but they don't do anything about it. When people who see bullying know what to do and they do it, they can help make a bad situation better.

It's also bullying when other people hide it from those who can help (teachers, bosses), when other people see it but ignore it, or when a person helps the bully to do it without getting in trouble. 

School teachers and staff have tried to learn ways to stop bullying. However, bullying can be easy to hide.

Some countries and regions have laws against it.

Bullying can happen almost anywhere. This includes at school, at work, at home, and on the internet (cyber-bullying).

A goal is part of what makes bullying what it is. There are many goals that bullies can have, including:

Bullying may be a mix of some of these tactics. For example, Lance Armstrong said, "Yes, I was a bully. I was a bully in the sense that I tried to control the narrative and if I didn't like what someone said, I turned on them." In other words, when someone said something that Armstrong didn't like, he "ran [them] over" and bullied them.

Bullying also includes using power or position in the wrong way. This can mean making comments or threats about losing a job. The person that is getting bullied then feels insecure (not sure) about themselves. Bullying also includes moving the goalposts by setting goals which subtly change in ways that cannot be reached.

Bullying happens for a reason. Most of the time, the bully is either not getting the attention they want or they are going through problems and want to get it through bullying. Another reason could be that the person does not feel good about themselves, so they bully others to make themselves feel stronger. Therefore, when the person wants to get attention and make others believe they are powerful, they may start saying mean things to other people or starting fights.

Bullying culture means, that it is normal to be bullied for the victim. It is about the abuse of social powers. The culture of bullying includes daily activities and the way people relate to each other. A bullying culture emphasizes a win/lose way of thinking. It also encourages domination and aggression.

Many people do not know how to deal with bullying. In school, the first thing one should do is to tell an adult that they trust. Someone who is bullied may want to keep friends around. If a bully comes to you, try to stay calm and get away safely.

Some charities (groups made to help people) are made to fight bullying and to help the people who are bullied. There are laws against bullying in the UK, such as Section 89 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006.

Some cases of bullying have resulted in suicide.



Make Poverty History

Make Poverty History is a British and Irish campaign that wants to stop people from being poor and to help richer people learn about the poor people of the World. The symbol of the campaign is a white "awareness wristband" made of cotton or silicone with the words written in dark black and the word 'poverty' written in light black ("e.g.:" 'MAKEPOVERTYHISTORY').


Saint James's Palace

Saint James's Palace is a royal palace in the City of Westminster, in London. It is between Pall Mall and The Mall, two streets in Central London, and opposite St James's Park. It is a working royal palace, and it is not open to the public. It was the most important home of the British royal family until Queen Victoria moved to Buckingham Palace in 1837.

Henry VIII built the palace in the early 1530s. Charles I spent his last night here before his execution in 1649.

Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn

Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn was the fourth son of George III of the United Kingdom.

Edward Augustus married in 1818 Princess Victoria Duchess of Kent. He had one daughter, who was later Queen Victoria. He died when his daughter was six months old in 1819.

Parlophone Records

Parlophone Records is a German-British major record label, which began in Germany in 1896. It is best known as one of the record labels who put out music by The Beatles in the 1960s. Parlophone's L-shaped logo began as the logo of the German Lindstrom label, which became part of Parlophone.

The company became part of EMI in 1931, and was known at the time especially for jazz and comedy records. They also issued records of "regional music", including works by Scottish and Latin recording artists. George Martin, staff producer, sometimes travelled to Scotland to record popular artists there.

The Beatles were signed to Parlophone in 1962, and released most of their albums on the label.

Parlophone continues today with artists like Coldplay, Lily Allen, and Radiohead.

In 2012, Universal Music Group bought EMI (the owner of Parlophone), but Universal chose to sell Parlophone to Warner Music Group. However, The Beatles’ catalogue still remains with UMG, through its Calderstone Productions label.

Fire-stick farming

Fire-stick farming are words used by Australian archaeologist Rhys Jones in 1969. They describe the way that Indigenous Australians used fire regularly to burn the land. This helped hunting by herding the animals into particular areas, and also caused new grass to grow which attracted more animals. Over many years it changed the types of plants and animals that lived in an area.

Fire-stick farming had turned scrub into grassland, which increased the number of grass eating animals such as the kangaroo. Scientists say that the changes caused by fire-stick farming caused the extinction of the Australian megafauna.

In the forests, fire-stick farming opened up clear areas and let more plants grow at ground level. This increased the number of animals that could feed on these plants, such as the herbivore marsupials.



Derek and Clive

Derek and Clive were a comedy character duo made up by Dudley Moore and Peter Cook. They can be seen as more offensive version of the earlier characters Pete and Dud. They used many swear words and worked as lavatory attendants.



Peter Cook

Peter Cook (17 November 1937 – 9 January 1995) was a English satirist, writer, actor and comedian. He was born in Torquay, Devon and became famous when he appeared in a stage show called "Beyond the Fringe" in 1960.

He later continued working with another star of "Beyond the Fringe", Dudley Moore. Two of the things they did together were Not Only... But Also and later Derek and Clive. They also appeared in films like the original Bedazzled.

Cook later helped start the magazine "Private Eye". He also was involved with comedy performances for Amnesty International. 

He died of liver disease in Hampstead, London. He is still regarded as a major influence in British comedy.


Miocene

The Miocene is the last and final epoch of the first Neogene period and the fourth of the Cainozoic. It started about 23 million years ago and ended about 5.33 million years ago. The rock beds that mark the start and end are well known, but the exact dates of the start and end of the period are uncertain. The Miocene was named by Charles Lyell. The name comes from the Greek words (', “less”) and (', “new”) and means "less recent", because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene.

The animals at the end of the Miocene are quite different from those at the start. What happened was climate change. The initial climate was wet and wooded. Herbivores like elephants and rhinos had teeth suitable for browsing; they ate leaves and small branches, not grass.

The biota becomes 'modern' because the climate has become more like it is today. That much is certain, but what is not certain is the exact cause of the climate change.

As the Earth cooled, it went from the Oligocene epoch, through the Miocene, and into the Pliocene. The Miocene boundaries are not set at any particular world wide event. They are set at regional boundaries between the warmer Oligocene and the cooler Pliocene epochs.

The plants and animals of the Miocene were not yet modern, and familiar present-day species had not yet evolved. Modern families of mammals and birds existed. Whales, seals, and kelp spread. Modern sharks appeared. Grasslands became more common. Mammalian browsers became less common, and grazer species became more common. About 100 species of ape lived at that time. They lived in Africa, Asia and Europe. Cetaceans were very common in the seas. The gigantic shark "Carcharodon megalodon" may have preyed on them.

The standard reason why the Earth's climate varies is that there are Milankovich cycles. They cause variations in the Earth's orbit. These changes affect the climate. Changes taking place "at present" have to consider the influence of humans as well. Over long periods the position of continents and the growth and decay of mountain ranges can also have big effects.

The climate was warm in the Miocene, especially in the first half. 
Then the global climate rivalled that of the Oligocene. The diagram shows that throughout the Oligocene and the first half of the Miocene, climate remained very warm.
The Miocene warm period began 21 million years ago and continued until about 14.5 million years ago. Then global temperatures took a sharp drop — it is called the "Middle Miocene Climate Transition" (MMCT) or "Middle Miocene disruption". 

Eight million years ago, the temperature dropped again, and the Antarctic ice sheet grew. Greenland may have had large glaciers as early as seven or eight million years ago. The climate for the most part remained warm enough to support forests well into the Pliocene.

A large impact event occurred during the Miocene. The date is very uncertain. The event formed the Karakul crater (52 km diameter), in Tajikistan which is estimated to have an age of less than 23 mya or less than 5 mya.

The large mountain ranges: the Himalayas, the Andes and the Cascades continued to go upwards. This was due to movements of continental plates grinding against each other. The movement of India into Asia, and the Americas moving against plates to the west caused all these area to buckle up into large ranges.

How would new mountain ranges lower global temperature? This has several possible causes. A falling CO would cause the temperature to drop, so the real question is, what would cause the CO to drop? One type of cause is CO being sequestered (hidden away) by, for instance, organic remains not being recycled. A quite different type of cause points to changes in the Earth's orbit or changes in the heat given out by the Sun (called "insolation").

Africa (and elsewhere) was much more forested than today, and the herbivorous mammals were mainly browsers (eating leaves) rather than grazers (eating grass). The advantage was with browsers because Africa was generally wet and forested. 

In the second half of the Miocene temperatures dropped, and grasslands began to expand. After the mid-Miocene climate change there grew vast grasslands in place of the forests which were there before. The browsers had teeth and behaviours which suited forests, and they largely died out. The modern herbivores are almost entirely grazers which "mow the lawns" of the huge African grasslands. This can be seen by comparing their teeth with the teeth of species from the earlier part of the Miocene. The same is true of the Americas and Asia. The world was drier, and grasslands spread. Browsers became extinct, and grazers took over.

"All flesh is grass" (Hebrew: כָּל־הַבָּשָׂ֣ר חָצִ֔יר kol habbasar chatsir) is a phrase from the Old Testament book of Isaiah, chapter 40, verses 6–8. It applies from the last part of the Miocene to the present day, at any rate so far as land animals are concerned. The steppes of Asia, the mid-West of the USA and the grasslands of Africa all offer the same lesson: that when the temperature and rainfall dropped, most of the forests changed to grassland. Atmospheric carbon dioxide is the other factor which research looks at. One fundamental cause of the change was the drop in rainfall in Africa and Arabia. This was partly caused by the rise of the Himalayas, which interfered with the flow of air from the wet tropical parts of the East. A major and permanent cooling occurred between 14.8 14.5 mya in the Langhian stage. However, as mentioned above, the grasslands expanded all over the Earth, not just in Africa.

There was a major growth in the Antarctic ice sheet. Ice cores tell us what happened: O:O is a proxy for temperature.

In an indirect way, all this affected human evolution. The reduction in forests led to an expanse of grasslands with some trees. Into this more open area the Australopithecines later ventured out.

Another great event, which undoubtedly affected climate, was the refilling of the Mediterranean basin. The so-called Zanclean flood is thought to have refilled the Mediterranean Sea 5.33 million years ago.
This reconnected the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. It is possible that even before the flood there were partial connections to the Atlantic Ocean.

According to this model, water from the Atlantic Ocean refilled the dried up basin through the modern-day Strait of Gibraltar. The process took up to two years.

The flood may have affected global climate. The much smaller flood triggered when Lake Agassiz drained did result in (or coincide with) a cold period.

During the early Miocene, the Arabian Peninsula collided with Eurasia. This cut the link between the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean. It let animals move between Africa and Eurasia, (elephants into Eurasia). In the late Miocene, the connection between the Atlantic and Mediterranean shut. This caused the Mediterranean Sea to almost completely evaporate. The Strait of Gibraltar opened and the Mediterranean refilled at the Miocene-Pliocene boundary: the Zanclean flood.

North and South America continued to drift westward. As they did so, their western edges gradually built up, and their eastern edges trailed.

There was as yet no land connection between the two continents. However, many groups can cross water to some extent. This is illustrated by the mammalian fauna of Madagascar, which is mostly got from Africa even though the two landmasses separated 120 mya.


Asterales

The Asterales are an order of flowering plants which include the composite family Asteraceae (sunflowers, daisies, thistles, etc.) and its related families.

Asteraceae

The family Asteraceae or Compositae (the aster, daisy, or sunflower family) is the largest family of flowering plants. It has the most species. 

What looks like its flower is really made of hundreds or thousands of tiny individual flowers. The technical term for it is a pseudanthium ("false flower"). 

The driving force for the evolution of the Asteraceae was that the composite flowers look attractive to pollinating insects. A large brightly coloured flower attracts insects. The other quality insects like is the scent of the pollen and the sugary nectar in the flowers. The asters are very successful (over 32,000 known species of flowering plants in over 1,900 genera in the order Asterales). Their success is due to what they offer to visiting insects. It is also due to their ability to grow almost anywhere, but especially on grass.

Heterocarpy, or amphicarpy, the ability of an annual species to produce different fruit morphs, is common in Asteraceae. It allows seeds to be dispersed over varying distances, each type adapted to different environment. This increases the chances of survival.

Australian Defence Force

The Australian Defence Force (ADF) is the military organisation responsible for the defence of Australia. It is made up of the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Army, the Royal Australian Air Force and a number of joint groups.

At first the Australian Government set up three separate armed services. In 1976, the government decided to have a single military headquarters. Over time, the three services have combined headquarters, logistics and training camps.

The ADF is small, but uses a lot of technology. With 53,000 full-time active-duty service people and 20,000 part-time reserve forces, it is the largest military force in Oceania. It is much smaller than most Asian military forces. The ADF does not have enough people in some highly skilled areas, but it is still able to send forces in many regions outside Australia.


COSHH

Car navigation allows an automobile driver to see where he or she is on a map at any given time. Automobile navigation can rely on GPS (Global Positioning System), or it can be DVD- or data-based. GPS-bsed navigation uses radio signals from special satellites that send their position and the time of transmission. The GPS receiver catches the signal and calculates the time. The GPS can then calculate the distance from the satellite with the well-known radio signal speed.

When driving a car with such a GPS receiver, the driver may receive information from a satellite which is above for instance Dover in the south and another one which is above Perth in the north. Then the GPS receiver knows precisely how far it is from Dover and how far it is from Perth. With that "two" possible positions of the car at the flat land are precisely determined.

To know which one of those positions is the right place, the GPS receiver needs a third satellite, for instance above Land's End in the west. With that information, the GPS receiver can also determine elevation. With three satellites in fact there is still a third possible point, but that is twice as high as the satellites above the earth's surface and does not need to be reckoned with in car travel.
But the GPS receiver still needs a fourth satellite, because the GPS receiver needs to know the time very precisely. In between it knows your car position, so that it can calculate the distance from that satellite. Then it knows the time of reception, because that is the time of transmission plus the travel time of the signal.

At any moment the GPS receiver searches for the strongest satellites, calculates the position and the driving direction and then shows it all on a small screen as a three-dimensional map. With that it also shows the vehicle's driving speed and how far it is to the next junction.

The driver may add the address where he or she wants to go. The GPS receiver then directs the driver to their destination step-by-step, often using voice prompts. The driver can even be shown where there are traffic jams, speed cameras and traffic lights, and the route can be calculated in such a way that these can be avoided, reducing the time needed for the driver to reach his or her destination.

If the driver deviates from the indicated route, the GPS receiver can provide new directions to the same destination, by repeating the same calculations.

To show where the car is with the calculated position, the GPS receiver contains digital maps. Many GPS receivers allow users to add more maps or newer maps to allow for better navigation.

Mobile phones are often equipped with GPS receivers, but most require a mobile Internet connection to function. Nokia's HERE Maps are able to store maps for offline use, and because of this, phones that have this app installed can be used as GPS navigation systems as mentioned above.

Spiral

A spiral is a special curve in mathematics. This curve starts at a point, and then goes around the point, but gets farther and farther away from it. This is different from a circle (which is always at the same distance) or an ellipse. A spiral is an "open" curve, unlike circles and ellipses which are closed curves.

A two-dimensional spiral may be described most easily using polar coordinates. There the radius "r" is a continuous monotonic function of angle θ ("theta"). The circle would be regarded as a degenerate case. With the circle, the function would not be strictly monotonic, but constant.

Some of the more important sorts of two-dimensional spirals include:

For simple 3-d spirals, a third variable, "h" (height), is also a continuous, monotonic function of θ. For example, a conic helix may be defined as a spiral on a conic surface, with the distance to the apex an exponential function of θ.

The helix and vortex can be viewed as a kind of three-dimensional spiral.

For a helix with thickness, see spring (math).

The study of spirals in nature have a long history, Christopher Wren found out that many shells form a logarithmic spiral. Jan Swammerdam observed the common mathematical characteristics of a wide range of shells from "Helix" to "Spirula" and Henry Nottidge Moseley described the mathematics of univalve shells. D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson's "On Growth and Form" gives extensive treatment to these spirals. He describes how shells are formed by rotating a closed curve around a fixed axis, the shape of the curve remains fixed but its size grows in a geometric progression. In some shell such as "Nautilus" and ammonites the generating curve revolves in a plane perpendicular to the axis and the shell will form a planer discoid shape. In others it follows a skew path forming a helico-spiral pattern.

Thompson also studied spirals occurring in horns, teeth, claws and plants.

Spirals in plants and animals are frequently described as whorls.

A model for the pattern of florets in the head of a sunflower was proposed by H Vogel. This has the form
where formula_2 is the index number of the floret and formula_3 is a constant scaling factor, and is a form of Fermat's spiral. The angle 137.5° is related to the golden ratio and gives a close packing of florets.

The spiral also represents infinity. Starting at a single point, and revolving outwardly until the end of the universe. Because of this, some civilizations believe that the Spiral is a pathway to the afterlife.

The spiral plays an important role in symbolism. It appears in megalithic art, notably in the Newgrange tomb or in many Galician petroglyphs such as the one in Mogor. See also triple spiral.

Scholars are still talking about the subject, but many of them now believe that the simple spiral in Chinese art may be a symbol of the sun. Roof tiles from the Tang Dynasty with this symbol have been found west of the ancient city of Chang'an (modern-day Xian).

The spiral is the most ancient symbol found on every civilized continent. Because it appears at burial sites across the globe, the spiral most likely represented the "life-death-rebirth" cycle. Similarly, the spiral symbolized the sun, as ancient people thought the sun was born each morning, died each night, and was reborn the next morning. 

Spirals are also a symbol of hypnosis. This most likely comes from the cliché of people and cartoon characters being hypnotized by staring into a spinning spiral (One example being Kaa in Disney's "The Jungle Book"). They are also used as a symbol of dizziness, where the eyes of a cartoon character, especially in anime and manga, will turn into spirals to show they are dizzy or dazed. The spiral symbolizes the double helix structure of DNA, representing biological evolution, and the spiral structure of a galaxy.

Carmine (color)

Carmine is the general term for a particularly deep red color. Some rubies are colored the color shown in the color chart below as "rich carmine". The deep red color shown at right as "carmine" is the color of the raw unprocessed pigment, but lighter, richer, or brighter colors are produced when the raw pigment is processed, some of which are shown below.

The color carmine comes from the pigment "carmine", which is a deep red color obtained from the carminic acid produced by some scale insects, such as the cochineal and the Polish cochineal, and is used as a general term for a particularly deep red color. The pigment carmine is used in the manufacture of artificial flowers, paints, rouge, yogurt, cosmetics, food additives, and crimson ink.

The first recorded use of "carmine" as a color name in English was in 1523.


Taupe

Taupe refers to a dark grayish-brown color. The word "taupe" derives from the Latin name for the European Mole, "Talpa europaea". 

Originally, this referred only to the average color of the French mole, but like the colors pink and lavender, the name expanded (in the case of "taupe" beginning in the 1940s) to encompass a wide range of varying shades. It seems that this occurred because the color of the fur of the mole can itself be a wide range of shades, from gray through yellowish, brownish, and even purplish.

The first use of "taupe" as a color name in English was in the early 1800s (exact year is not known).

National Liberal Party

National Liberal Party can be any of the following parties:


National Liberal Party (Romania)

The Partidul Național Liberal ("National Liberal Party") is a conservative liberal political party in Romania. It is a "historical" renewed liberal party in Romania. The party was founded in 1875 and re-founded in early 1990. In 2022, it was the second biggest party in the Romanian Parliament.

On 26 July 2014, the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL) formed an alliance with the National Liberal Party. The alliance was named the "Christian Liberal Alliance" (ACL).

Gravitational constant

The gravitational constant, called formula_1 in physics equations, is an empirical physical constant. It is used to show the force between two objects caused by gravity. The gravitational constant appears in Isaac Newton's universal law of gravitation.

formula_1 is about N⋅m/kg, and is denoted by letter formula_1. In the SI system, the constant is equal to the force in newtons that two objects, each with a mass of 1 kilogram, exert on each other at a distance of 1 meter.

It usually appears in Sir Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation, and in Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. It is also known as the universal gravitational constant, Newton's constant, and colloquially as Big G. It should not be confused with "small g" ("g"), which is the local gravitational field of the Earth (equivalent to the free-fall acceleration).

Chepstow

Chepstow () is a town in Monmouthshire, Wales. It is next to the border with England. It is built beside the River Wye, close to where it joins with the River Severn. It is near the western end of the Severn Bridge on the M48 motorway. It is east of Newport and west of London. Named Striguil in Norman times (from a Welsh word meaning bend in the river), by the 14th century it had its current name - from the Old English ceap/chepe meaning market, and stowe meaning place. In Welsh it's called Cas-Gwent, meaning castle of Gwent.

Chepstow is famous for its castle, the oldest stone castle still standing in Britain, and for Chepstow Racecourse which is home to the Welsh Grand National. The course was officially opened in 1926. Chepstow Racecourse is just 16 miles from Bristol, making it easy to access from England via the Severn Bridge.

Chepstow's past includes shipbuilding and salmon fishing, the export of timber and oak bark and the import of wine. And in the 18th century the town became popular with visitors following the Wye Tour. Chepstow Museum tells the story of the Wye Tour, and is a short walk from the beautiful Regency iron bridge known as the Old Wye Bridge.

Victoria Cross

The Victoria Cross (VC) is the highest military medal given for bravery "in the face of the enemy" to members of the defence forces of Commonwealth countries, and former British Empire territories. It is the most important medal, more important than all other orders, decorations and medals. 

It may be given to a person of any rank in any service (army, navy or air force) or anyone working for the military. It is usually presented to the person, or a family member if they were killed, by the British monarch during a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. It can be presented by the Governor-General for awards made by other Commonwealth countries. 

It is the joint highest medal for bravery in the United Kingdom with the George Cross, which is for bravery "not" in the face of the enemy. However, the VC is higher in the order of importance and would be worn first by a person who had been given both medals (which has not happened).

The VC was begun on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria for acts of bravery during the Crimean War. Since then, the medal has been given 1,356 times to 1,353 people. Only 13 medals, nine to members of the British Army, and four to the Australian Army have been presented since the Second World War.

Since 1990, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, have started their own versions of the VC.

The list of living s of the Victoria Cross is small.


Pit (Kid Icarus)




Pit is based on Icarus and Eros (also known as Cupid), figures from Greek mythology. The clothes that he wears and the fact that he is an angel resembles Perseus, Bellerophon, and Hercules, the last also being an archer. His looks have changed very little over the years, having always included things that have to do with classical antiquity (such as the chiton and sandals). His weapon is the bow and arrow. In "Of Myths and Monsters", Pit first received a crown of laurel, as well as revealing his eye color, blue. In "Super Smash Bros. Brawl", Pit is seen wearing an exomis. On the official "Super Smash Bros. Brawl" website, it is said that Pit is an angel that cannot normally fly. Much like Samus Aran from the "Metroid" series and Link from "The Legend of Zelda (series)" series, Pit did not talk much in Super Smash Bros. Brawl.

As part of changing the character, the designers of "Super Smash Bros. Brawl" changed his looks by combining parts of his looks from the promotional artworks of both Kid Icarus titles with new ideas. Pit now appears older than the child-age designs from older games and now has a more anime/manga-like appearance, although he still seems to have a childish voice in the Japanese version. In The English version of Super Smash Bros. Brawl, he has a deeper-sounding teenaged voice. Nintendo has described the redesign as "a giant leap forward in his evolution". It is also said on the "Smash Bros. Dojo" that one of Pit's color changes is black, a ""Fallen Angel color"" choice. This new look had became popular among most nintendo fans. It will be used for the upcoming Kid Icarus Uprising.


Solomonovo

Solomonovo (; ) is a village in the Uzhhorodskyi Raion (district) in the Zakarpattia Oblast (province) in western Ukraine.

According to the 2001 census, 1342 people were living there.


Zakarpattia Oblast

Zakarpattia Oblast (, translit. ; , translit. ; ; ; also referred to as the Transcarpathian Oblast, Transcarpathia, Zakarpattya, or historically Subcarpathian Rus) is an administrative oblast (province) in western Ukraine. Its administrative center is the city of Uzhhorod. Other major cities within the oblast include Mukachevo, Khust, Berehove and Chop which is home to railroad transport infrastructure.

Zakarpattia Oblast was formally established on January 22, 1946 after the incorporation of Subcarpathian Rus lands to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. During the Ukrainian independence referendum held in 1991, Zakarpattia Oblast voters were given a separate option on whether or not they favored autonomy for the region. Although a large majority favored autonomy, it was not granted.

Zakarpattia Oblast is in the Carpathian Mountains landscape of western Ukraine, and is the only Ukrainian administrative division which borders upon four countries: Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania. The Carpathian Mountains play a major part in the oblast's economy, making the region an important tourist and travel destination housing many ski and spa resorts.

The oblast is ranked 23rd by area and 17th by population. According to the 2001 Ukrainian Census, the population of Zakarpattia Oblast is 1,254,614. Excluding Ukrainians, this total includes people of many different nationalities of which Hungarians, Romanians and Rusyns constitute significant minorities in some of the province's cities, while in others, they form the majority of the population (as in the case of Berehove).

Zakarpattia Oblast has a total area of 12,800 km² and is in the Carpathian Mountains region of western Ukraine. It is the only Ukrainian oblast to have boundaries with four countries: Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. On the West it borders the Prešov and Košice Regions of Slovakia and Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén and Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg Counties of Hungary, on the South—the Satu Mare and Maramureş Counties of Romania, on the East and Northeast—Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, and on the North—Lviv Oblast and the Subcarpathian Voivodeship of Poland.

Zakarpattia Oblast mostly consists of mountains and small hills covered with deciduous and coniferous forests, as well as alpine meadows. Mountains cover about 80% of the oblast's area, and cross from North-East to South-East. The Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians, part of which are within Zakarpattia Oblast, were recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007.

The largest rivers that flow through the oblast include the Tysa, Borzhava, and the Tereblia. The region's climate is moderate and continental with about 700-1000 millimetres of rainfall per year. The average temperature in summer is +21°С (70°F) and -4°С (25 °F) in winter. With a total height of , Hoverla, part of the Chornohora mountain range, is the tallest point in the oblast. The lowest point, 101 metres above sea level, is in the village of Ruski Heyevtsi in the Uzhhorodskyi Raion.

The four of the oblast's historical-cultural sites were nominated for the Seven Wonders of Ukraine competition in 2007: Palanok Castle, Museum upon the Chorna River, Mykhailiv Orthodox Church, and the Nevytsky Castle.

Zakarpattia was part of Kingdom of Hungary, later Austria-Hungary until the latter's demise at the end of World War I. This region was briefly part of the short-lived West Ukrainian National Republic in 1918 and occupied by Romania at end of that year. It was later recaptured by Hungary in the summer of 1919. Finally, it joined the newly formed Czechoslovakia as "Subcarpathian Rus", of which it formed one of the four main regions, the others being Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia.

During the World War II German occupation of Czechoslovakia, the southern part of the region was awarded to Hungary under the First Vienna Award in 1938. The remaining portion was constituted as an autonomous region of the short-lived Second Czecho-Slovak Republic. After the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia on March 15, 1939 and the Slovak declaration of an independent state, Ruthenia declared its independence (Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine) but it was immediately occupied and later annexed by Hungary.

During the German occupation of Hungary in 1944, almost the entire Jewish population was deported; few survived the Holocaust. When the Soviet Army crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President Edvard Beneš formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the Soviet Union. It was then incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, it became part of independent Ukraine as "Zakarpattia Oblast".

The province has a unique footnote in history as the only region in the former Soviet Union to have had an American governor: its first governor was Gregory Zatkovich, an American citizen who had earlier emigrated from the region and represented the Rusyn community in the U.S. Zatkovich was appointed governor by Czechoslovakia's first president, Tomáš Masaryk, in 1920 and served for about one year until he resigned over differences regarding the region's autonomy.

After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine held an independence referendum in which the residents of Zakarpattia were asked about the Zakarpattia Oblast Council's proposal for self rule. About 78% of the oblast's population voted in favor of autonomy, however, it was not granted. There were also propositions of separating from Ukraine to rejoin Czechoslovakia, but after Czechoslovakia's dissolution into the Czech Republic and Slovakia on January 1, 1993, these ideas have been rendered largely moot.

On October 25, 2008, delegates to the Congress Of Carpathian Ruthenians declared the formation of the Republic of Carpathian Ruthenia. The prosecutor’s office of Zakarpattia region has filed a case against Russian Orthodox Church priest Dmytro Sidor and Yevhen Zhupan, an Our Ukraine deputy of the Zakarpattia regional council and chairman of the People’s Council of Ruthenians, on charges of encroaching on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine.

Zakarpattia Oblast's local administration is controlled by the Zakarpattia Oblast Council ("rada"). The Chairman of the Council is Mykhailo Kichkovskyi, elected from the People's Union "Our Ukraine" party. Kichkovsky holds this position since his election in April 2006.

The Zakarpattia Oblast Rada consists of a total of 90 deputies. Based on the March 26, 2006 regional election results, the distribution of the council's mandates is as follows: 30 mandates for the People's Union "Our Ukraine;" 25 for the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc; 7 for the Lytvyn People's Bloc; 5 for the Party of Hungarians of Ukraine "KMKS;" 4 for the Democratic Party of Hungarians of Ukraine; and 4 for the Socialist Party of Ukraine.

The oblast's governor (currently Oleh Havashi) is appointed by the President of Ukraine.

Zakarpattia Oblast is administratively subdivided into 13 raions (districts), as well as 5 cities (municipalities) which are directly subordinate to the oblast government: Berehove, Chop, Khust, Mukachevo, and the administrative center of the oblast, Uzhhorod. There are a total of 7 cities, 19 towns, and more than 579 villages.

Zakarpattia Oblast can also be divided into four unofficial geographic-historic regions (counties): Ung, Bereg, Ugocsa, and Northern Maramuresh.

The following data incorporates the number of each type of administrative divisions of Zakarpattia Oblast:


There are 13 raions (districts) in the oblast:

Largest cities and towns in the province are (with population figures in 2007):

According to the 2001 Ukrainian Census, the population of Zakarpattia Oblast is 1,254,614. The current estimated population is 1.2 million people (as of 2004).

Although ethnic Ukrainians are in majority here (80.5%), other ethnic groups are relatively numerous in Zakarpattia. The largest of these are Hungarians (12.1%), Romanians (2.6%), Russians (2.5%), Roma (1.1%), Slovaks (0.5%) and Germans (0.3%). The Ukrainian government does not recognize the Rusyn people living in that country as a distinct nationality but rather as an ethnic group of Ukrainians. About 10,100 people (0.8%) identify themselves as Rusyns according to the last census.

Their languages and culture are respected by the provision of education, clubs, etc. in their respective languages. Those who recognize Ukrainian as their native language total 81.0% of the population, Hungarian — 12.7%, Russian — 2.9%, Romanian — 2.6%, and Rusyn — 0.5% Residents in seven of Mukachivskyi Raion's villages have the option to learn the Hungarian language in a school or home school environment.

Zakarpattia is home to approximately 14,000 ethnic Roma (otherwise known as Gypsies), the largest population of Roma in Ukraine. The first Hungarian College in Ukraine is in Berehovo, the II. Rákoczi Ferenc College.

Zakarpattia Oblast's economy depends mostly on trans-border trade, vinery and forestry. The oblast is also home to a special economic zone.

The oblast's main industry includes woodworking. Other industries include food, light industry, and mechanical engineering.

Judgment Day (2009)

Judgment Day (2009) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which took place on May 17, 2009 at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Illinois,<ref name="date/location"></ref> a suburb of Chicago.


Night of Champions (2009)

Night of Champions (2009) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which took place on July 26, 2009 at the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was the third annual event under the Night of Champions name and the ninth annual event under the Vengeance/Night of Champions chronology. Similar to the previous two events, the concept of the show was that every championship in the company would be defended. It featured talent from the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands. Eight matches were contested on the card.

Night of Champions will have professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers from the "Raw", "Friday Night SmackDown", and "ECW on Sci Fi" brands. Wrestlers will play a villain or a hero. All wrestlers will be from WWE's Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands—a storyline division in which WWE employees are assigned to a television program of the same name.

The main rivalry from SmackDown for Night of Champions is between CM Punk and Jeff Hardy in their battle over the World Heavyweight Championship. One month before the show, at Extreme Rules, Punk used his guaranteed title match he earned by winning the Money in the Bank ladder match against Hardy; he beat him, and won the World Heavyweight title. The two had many confrontations about it which lead to The Bash and a match that saw Punk get disqualified for kicking the referee. Then, Hardy attacked Punk because Hardy thought Punk kicked the referee on purpose. On the July 2 episode of "Superstars" fans were told that Punk had suffered a storyline eye injury. Punk's reasoning to Hardy's accusation was that he kicked the referee on accident due to his inability to clearly see Jeff, who he was really trying to kick. To settle the dispute on to who the rightful champion was, SmackDown general manager, Theodore Long, announced another match between the two at Night of Champions, which was accepted by both competitors.

Raw will be represented by Randy Orton defending the WWE Championship. After beating Triple H at The Bash, Orton did not have a contender for the championship, so on the June 29 episode of "Raw", special guest host of the week, as well as onscreen matchmaker, Batista, said that the title would be defended at Night of Champions against the winner of a single-elimination tournament. The first two matches of the four-person tournament were that night with Triple H beating Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and John Cena beating The Miz (Mike Mizanin). Triple H and Cena wrestled each other the next week on "Raw", but Orton's allies, Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase, interfered in the match, attacking both Cena and Triple H. Because of that, it was announced Orton would defend the title against both Triple H and Cena in a triple threat match.


SummerSlam (2009)

SummerSlam (2009) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which took place on August 23, 2009 at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. It was the 22nd annual SummerSlam event and featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands. Eight matches were contested on the event's card.

Survivor Series (2009)

Survivor Series (2009) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), that took place on November 22, 2009 at the Verizon Center in Washington, D.C.. It was the twenty-third and last Survivor Series and featured WWE Employees.

Ezekiel Hart

Ezekiel Hart (; May 15, 1770 - September 16, 1843) was a Jewish Canadian businessman and politician, and the first Jew to be elected to public office in the British Empire.

He was born May 15, 1770 at Trois-Rivières, Quebec to Aaron Hart and Dorothea Judah.

Ezekiel Hart created a brewery with his brothers in Trois-Rivières and, on April 11, 1807 was elected to the "Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada". Because he was Jewish, he swore his oath on a Hebrew Bible, instead of a Christian Bible, and while wearing a kippah. At the time, British laws did not let Jews have important positions like these, and Hart was expelled from the assembly. He was elected again in 1808 and expelled again.
He did not run for public office again. He continued to live in Trois-Rivières where he was a successful businessman and well-respected member of the community. He served in the militia during the War of 1812 and became colonel in 1830.

He came from a very important and rich family. His father, Aaron Hart, was member of the British forces, and a well-known businessman in Canada. His brothers, Moses and Benjamin, were important businessmen at Trois-Rivières and Montreal. His cousin, Henry Judah, later became a member of the "Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada".

Ezekiel Hart died on September 16, 1843 at Trois-Rivières, at the age of 76.

Sampler (musical instrument)

A sampler is an electronic musical instrument that is similar to the synthesizer. What a sample does is that instead of creating sounds from scratch however, a sampler starts with more than one recording (or "samples") of different sounds added by the user, and then plays each back based on how the instrument is configured. Because these samples are usually stored in RAM, the information can be quickly accessed.

Headbangers Ball

Headbangers Ball is a television program about heavy metal and hardcore punk music airing on MTV2, and other channels.


Solar cooker

A solar cooker is a device that uses energy from sunlight. They use no fuel and do not cost anything to run. They also help slow deforestation and desertification. Another benefit of solar cooking is that, unlike cooking with fire, Solar cookers do not pollute the air. Solar cookers can be used for cooking outside. This is useful when using fire is risky or there is no fuel for the fire. The solar cooker is very useful. It uses the Sun which is a renewable source of energy.

Solar box cookers can be made of materials or be made in a factory and sold. There are many kinds of solar box cookers. They can be made from small cardboard boxes that can be used to cook a single meal, They can also be made of wood and glass boxes built into the sunny side of a house. 

The solar cooker was invented by Horace de Saussure, a Swiss naturalist, as early as 1767. They did not become popular until the 1970s. They are found in almost every country of the world.

House of mirrors

A house of mirrors or hall of mirrors is a traditional attraction at carnivals and amusement parks.

Phonograph

The phonograph is a device for the mechanical recording and reproduction of sound. It was the most common device for playing recorded music from the 1870s through the 1980s. It was invented by Thomas Edison, after other inventors had studied the idea. Early phonographs both recorded and played sound on cylinders. In its later forms, it is also called a gramophone (as a trademark since 1887, as a generic name in the UK since 1910) or, since the 1940s, a record player. 
Thomas Edison made his first phonograph with the mouth piece of the early telephone and some tinfoil. He thought he could talk into the mouth piece to make a disk vibrate, as the disk vibrated a needle would put grooves in the tinfoil. When Edison adjusted the machine to play and cranked the lever, he was surprised to hear his voice play back to him. He said his ideas rarely worked the first time. These cylinders could record sound, but due to their cylindrical shape, they could not be copied cheaply with a mold.

The phonograph was soon replaced by the graphophone by Alexander Graham Bell in his Volta Laboratory. Later it was replaced with the disc phonograph, cassette tapes, compact discs, audio files and other devices. These later inventions made stereo sound. 

The gramophone, invented by Emile Berliner, plays sounds from a flat disk record. The record is placed onto the turntable. The turntable spins the record while a lever with a small needle on the bottom lies between the little grooves in the disk. When the grooves make the needle vibrate, music is played. These machines do not record, but the disks could be copied quickly onto vinyl disks in a factory with a mold, called a master.

Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)

Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses) is the third album by Slipknot. Slipknot is an American heavy metal band. Roadrunner Records (a record label) released the album on May 25, 2004. It is the band's only album produced by Rick Rubin. The album had many singles, such as "Before I Forget" and "Duality".

The band released their second album, "Iowa", in 2001. After this album, the band did many different things. Members of Slipknot started other bands, such as Stone Sour, Murderdolls, and To My Surprise. They started recording the album in 2003. They recorded the album in The Mansion (a music studio). At first, the band did not make much music. The band's singer, Corey Taylor, was drinking alcohol. Still, the band made enough music for a new album. "Vol. 3" is different from Slipknot's first albums. It has different types of music, such as guitar solos and acoustic guitar music.

Many music critics liked the album. The RIAA gave the album a platinum certification. It went onto many national music charts. "Vol. 3" was number 2 on the US "Billboard" 200. It was also number 5 on the UK Albums Chart. The band won a Grammy Award for "Before I Forget".

All tracks written by Corey Taylor, Mick Thomson, Shawn Crahan, Craig Jones, Jim Root, Chris Fehn, Paul Gray, Joey Jordison and Sid Wilson.

Resaca Confederate Cemetery

Resaca Confederate Cemetery in Resaca, Georgia is home to over 400 confederate soldiers who died during the American Civil War, also known as the War Between the States. This particular cemetery is designated for the soldiers that fought in the Battle of Resaca which took place May 14 and 15, 1864. Although the battle lasted two days, there are only three graves where the death date is listed as May 15, 1864. The remaining graves are listed as May 14, 1864. There are 424 graves marked 'unknown'. 

After the battle, a family known as the Green family returned to their plantation and the sight that met them there was almost more than they could bear. The bodies of confederate soldiers were buried in crude makeshift graves all across the yard. Compelled by a since of respect to those who had fallen in action, Mary J. Green and her sister began collecting the bodies to bury properly. Though poverty was rampant the Green daughters wrote friends asking for any amount money they could give. Col. John Green gave his daughters 2.5 acres of land for use as a cemetery for these soldiers. With the money collected and the land provided, the Green daughters and their mother began work on what we now call the Resaca Confederate Cemetery.

The Resaca Confederate Cemetery was founded on October 25, 1866. This cemetery and one in Winchester, Virginia were both dedicated on the same day. Each group thought they were the first confederate cemetery.

Palm Sunday

Palm Sunday is a Christian festival. It is always happens on a Sunday but the date each year changes. It is a day to celebrate the day that Jesus entered the city of Jerusalem in Israel as was written about in the Bible in Mark 11:1-11, Matthew 21:1-11, Luke 19:28-44, and in John 12:12-19. During Palm Sunday many Christians celebrate with Crosses made out of Palm leaves and by going to church.

Many Christian churches mark Palm Sunday as the beginning of Holy Week which ends on Easter Sunday. It is an event celebrated by some churches by cutting branches of palm trees and attending mass. Palm Sunday is celebrated by most Christian churches all over the world including Roman Catholics and Protestants. However, Orthodox churches observe Palm Sunday at a later date following the Julian calendar. In some countries, palm leaves that were blessed during mass are displayed on the door of their houses believing that it will also bring blessings to their household. Some churches traditionally gather the palm leaves to be burned and used during the Ash Wednesday services. 



Passive solar building design

In passive solar building design, windows, walls, and floors are made to collect, store, and distribute solar energy in the form of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer. This is called passive solar design or climatic design because, unlike active solar heating systems, it doesn't involve
the use of mechanical and electrical devices.

The key to designing a passive solar home is to best take advantage of the local climate. Elements to be considered include window placement and glazing type, thermal insulation, thermal mass, and shading. Passive solar design techniques can be applied most easily to new buildings, but existing buildings can be adapted or "retrofitted".

Moraceae

Moraceae are often called the mulberry family or fig family, is a family of flowering plants comprising about 40 genera and over 1000 species. Included are well-known plants such as the fig, banyan, breadfruit, mulberry, and osage-orange.

Ulmaceae

Ulmaceae is a family of flowering plants that includes the elms (genus "Ulmus"), and the zelkovas (genus "Zelkova"). Members of the family are widely distributed throughout the north temperate zone, and have a scattered distribution elsewhere except for Australasia.

Vickie Guerrero

Vickie Lynn Guerrero (maiden name Lara)(born March 16, 1968) is an American professional wrestling authority figure. She is best known for her time with the WWE. She is the widow of professional wrestler and WWE Hall of Famer Eddie Guerrero. During her time in the WWE, she was known for yelling the catchphrase "Excuse Me!" which received negative reactions from the fans. She was also an occasional wrestler. she was also a manger for laycool

On June 23, 2014 episode of "Raw", Guerrero was fired after she lost a pudding match against Stephanie McMahon with her job on the line. McMahon won with help from Alicia Fox, Layla, and Rosa Mendes. Guerrero would get revenge on McMahon by throwing her into mud pool. She then pointed to the sky, said "this was for you"; as a tribute to her late husband, Eddie, and did Eddie's taunt before leaving.


Renewable energy in developing countries

Most developing countries have good renewable energy resources, including solar energy, wind power, geothermal energy, and biomass. These can help developing countries reduce their dependence on oil and natural gas. Investments in renewables can be less expensive than fossil fuel energy systems.

Renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries. In rural and remote areas, transmission and distribution of energy generated from fossil fuels can be difficult and expensive. Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative.

Interest in renewable energies has increased in recent years due to environmental concerns about global warming and air pollution, reduced costs of renewable energy technologies, and improved efficiency and reliability.

Renewable energy projects in many developing countries contribute to poverty alleviation by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment. Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking, space heating, and lighting.

Renewable energy can also contribute to education, by providing electricity to schools. Renewable energy for cooking and heating can reduce the time that children, spend out of school collecting fuel. In addition, the displacement of traditional fuels reduces the health problems from indoor air pollution produced by burning those fuels.

Renewable energy can also contribute to better health by providing energy to refrigerate medicine and sterilize medical equipment. It can also provide power for supplying the fresh water and sewerage services needed to reduce infectious disease.

Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita. More than 30,000 small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya
annually. For an investment of as little as $100 for the panel and wiring, the PV system can be used to charge a car battery, which can then provide power to run a fluorescent lamp or a small television for a few hours a day. More Kenyans adopt solar power every year than make connections to the country’s electric grid.



Yom Kippur War

The Yom Kippur War (also known as the Ramadan War and the October War) happened between Israel and a group of Arab countries, led by Egypt and Syria, from October 6 to 24, 1973. The war began on the Jewish day of repentance, Yom Kippur, and happened during the Muslim month of Ramadan, when the army was fasting. The attack by Egypt and Syria was a surprise to Israel, which had conquered the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights from Egypt in 1967 in retaliation for attacks against Israel that ultimately resulted in the occupation of Gaza.
The Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights had belonged to Egypt and Syria but became occupied by Israel since 1967 during the Six Day War. Syria's aim of the war was to liberate all of the Golan Heights.

During the first few days of the war, both Egypt and Syria scored victories. Israel was shocked by the attack and was about to be defeated. The first Israeli counterattacks failed against both Egypt and Syria. However, Israeli attacks later repelled the Syrian forces and pushed them back. The Iraqi Army joined the war, and the Israeli Army stopped advancing.

On the Egyptian front, Israel's attacks against Syria had served as a 'distraction' against the Egyptian offense. That allowed the Egyptian army to dig around 12 km deeper into Sinai, an extra 2 km to the original plan. Israel feared a massive military defeat and so called on America for aid. Initially, The US refused and so Israel threatened to use its nuclear weapons. That was enough to persuade US President Richard Nixon to send aid to Israel. America conducted Operation Nickel Grass, which gave Israel a resupply of 22,000 tons of military equipment and ammunition, as a response to the parallel Soviet supply operation in which 15,000 tons of equipment were airlifted, and 63,000 tons of equipment were sealifted. That aid was deniend at the time but was vital to Israel and allowed it to continue fighting despite being heavily outnumbered, according to Henry Kissinger.

Egypt crossed the Suez Canal on October 6 and destroyed the Israeli defences and forts on the other side. Israel tried for the next few days to defeat Egypt and push it back behind the canal. However, Israel could not push it back and so lured it deeper into the Sinai in an effort to encircle Egypt. The United States started sending ammunition and weapons to Israel by using airplanes to help it win the war in Operation Nickel Grass. Syria soon pleaded Egypt to attack Israel to lessen the pressure on it. On October 14, Egypt attacked again and tried to advance even more into the Sinai after Syria had reported a false victory against Israel in the northen front. That led to the Egyptians pushing forward into Israeli controlled territory without any air cover and allowed Israel to encircle the entire 20,000-man Egyptian 3rd Army and cut it off of any supplies by the invasion of mainland Egypt by Israeli forces. Egypt tried stopping the invasion by its elite 25th Armored Brigade with the most advanced tanks of the time, but it fell into an Israeli tank ambush and was completely destroyed.

Israel then attacked again and was pushing into mainland Egypt. After heavy fighting, it crossed the canal at its centre between two Egyptian armies. It advanced north and south until it had reached the city of Suez in the south and trapped the Egytian 3rd Army in the eastern side of the canal, in the Sinai. Anwar Sadat was worried by the encirclement of the 3rd Egyptian Army since its collapse could lead to that of the 2nd Egyptian Army and Egypt's whole war effort. That made him call Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev and urge him to stop the war quickly. Brezhnev brought in air-deployable battallions from Europe and threatened the US to end the war. Israeli tried to capture Suez but was defeated and failed to advance north. It had reached an area 101 km from Cairo, the capital of Egypt, and captured 1600 km2 of mainland Egypt.

The United Nations passed a resolution in the UN Security Council that asked all countries to bring a temporary stop to the war (called a 'ceasefire'). Both the Arab countries and Israel agreed, but the ceasefire failed since Israeli army advanced south to reach Suez. Brezhnev said to Nixon that if the US did not send troops, he would send Soviet troops to the area. The US believed that was a threat and so it put its military on full nuclear alert. That was the closest that both superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, had been to nuclear war and World War III since the Cuban Missile Crisis in the 1960s

The tension between the Americans and the Soviets made Israel agree to a ceasefire, which ended the war.

The war ended on October 26, 1973, Egypt and Israel then negotiated and reached an agreement to separate their forces. That agreement led to Israel withdrawing from the Suez Canal only six years after the war had ended, 

Israel also held negotiations with Syria and agreed to withdraw from the places that it had captured in Syria except the Golan Heights. Egypt and Israel kept their negotiations and in 1979 signed the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty. The treaty, which has held ever since, brought peace between Israel and Egypt, and Israel withdrawing from the whole Sinai and returning it to Egypt.

The Egyptians celebrated victory that day since they successfully attacked at the start of the war. The Syrians, on the other hand, do not like to talk about the war, as much of it was seen as a defeat, rather than a victory or stalemate.

Papaveraceae

Papaveraceae is a family of flowering plants. The family has been universally recognized by taxonomists, and is also known as the "poppy family". Most are herbaceous plants, but a few are shrubs and small trees.

Myristicaceae

Myristicaceae is the botanical name for a family of flowering plants, mostly from Africa, Asia, Pacific islands, and the Americas. The family has been recognised by most taxonomists, and it is sometimes called the "nutmeg family", after its most famous member, the nutmeg ("Myristica fragrans"). It has about 21 genera and 520 species. They are mostly trees and shrubs.

Dirac delta function

The Dirac delta function, often written as formula_1, is a made-up concept by mathematician Paul Dirac. It is a really pointy and skinny function that pokes out a point along a wave. Loosely speaking, it has the value of zero everywhere except at formula_2, in such a way that the area between the function and the "x"-axis adds up to 1. The delta function is often used in sampling theory, where its pointiness is useful for getting clean samples.

The integral of the Dirac delta function is the Heaviside function. The Dirac delta function can be seen as the derivative of the Heaviside function. 


Newton's method

Newton's method provides a way for finding the real zeros of a function. This algorithm is sometimes called the Newton–Raphson method, named after Sir Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson.

The method uses the derivative of the function in order to find its roots. An initial "guess value" for the location of the zero must be made. From this value, a new guess is calculated by this formula:

formula_1

Here x is the initial guess and x is the next guess. The function f (whose zero is being solved for) has the derivative f'.

By repeatedly applying this formula to the generated guesses (that is by setting the value of x to the formula's output and recomputing), the value of the guesses will approach a zero of the function.

Newton's method can be explained graphically by looking at intersections of tangent lines with the x-axis. First, a line tangent to the f at x is calculated. Next, the intersection between this tangent line and the x-axis is found. Finally, the x-position of this intersection is recorded as the next guess, x.

Newton's method can find a solution quickly if the guess value begins sufficiently near the desired root. However, when the initial guess value is not close, and depending on the function, Newton's method may find the answer slowly or not at all.


Asimo

ASIMO is a robot that was built by Honda on 2000. The current models could walk, run, and go up and down stairs. Engineers planned to add laser capabilities. Its height was 130 centimeters (4 feet 3 inches) and weight 54 kilograms (119 pounds). ASIMO was just like an astronaut wearing a backpack and could walk or run on two feet. 
ASIMO was created at Honda's Research & Development "Wako Fundamental Technical Research Center" in Japan. Honda will not confirm how much it costs.

ASIMO is an acronym. ASIMO stands for "Advanced Step in Innovative MObility". It should be pronounced “ah she moh” to match the original Japanese pronunciation.

As of February 2009, there are over 100 ASIMO units in existence.

ASIMO has made lots of public appearances.

Fahrenheit 451

Fahrenheit 451 is an American dystopian fiction novel. It was written by Ray Bradbury and first published in 1953.

The novel is about a future American society in which people are hedonistic (meaning they live only for pleasure), and reading is against the law because it makes them think. The main character, Guy Montag, has a job as a "fireman" (which, in this future, means "book burner"). The number "451" refers to the temperature (in Fahrenheit) at which the books burn when the "firemen" burn them "for the good of humanity". Written in the early years of the Cold War, the novel is a critique of what Bradbury saw as an increasingly dysfunctional American society.

The idea began with Bradbury's short story "Bright Phoenix," written in 1947 but first published in the "Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction" in 1963. The original short story was reworked into the novella, "The Fireman", and published in the February 1951 issue of "Galaxy Science Fiction". The novel was also serialized in the March, April, and May 1954 issues of "Playboy" magazine. Bradbury wrote the entire novel on a pay typewriter in the basement of UCLA's Powell library. His original idea in writing "Fahrenheit 451" was to show his great love for books and libraries. He has often referred to Montag as an allusion to himself.

Over the years, the novel has been subject to various interpretations, primarily focusing on the historical role of book burning in suppressing dissenting ideas. Bradbury has said that the novel is not about censorship; he says that "Fahrenheit 451" is a story about how television destroys interest in reading literature, which leads to people thinking that knowledge is made up of "factoids", partial information without context, such as Napoleon's birth date alone, without an indication of who he was.

A movie version of the novel was released in 1966, and at least two BBC Radio 4 dramatizations have also been aired, both of which follow the book very closely.

Collingwood School

Collingwood School is a private school in West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It teaches from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 12.

Collingwood School was opened in 1984 by West Vancouver and North Vancouver parents who wanted a private school nearby. The school was named after a ship called the HMCS Collingwood. The school used the buildings from the old Glenmore Elementary School. Now the school has buildings in two different parts of West Vancouver.

The "Morven" campus is the oldest part of the school. This is where they teach the older children, from Grade 6 to Grade 12. It is in a part of West Vancouver called the British Properties. The address is 70 Morven Drive, West Vancouver. The "Wentworth" campus was built later. This is where they teach the younger children, from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 5. It is right below Cypress Provincial Park in West Vancouver.


Stack (data structure)

The stack is one of the most important data structures in computer science. To understand how a stack works, think of a deck of playing cards that is face down. We can only easily access the card that is on top. When we want to look at the top card, there are two things we can do: we can peek at it, but leave it on the stack, or we can pop it off. When we pop off the top object, we are taking it off the stack. If we want to add another card to the top of the stack, we push. 

A stack is called a last-in-first-out (LIFO) collection. This means that the last thing we added (pushed) is the first thing that gets pulled (popped) off. If the last card we put on our stack of cards was an ace, then the first card we pulled from the top is that same ace.

The stack was first proposed in 1955, and then patented in 1957, by the German Friedrich L. Bauer. The same concept was developed independently, at around the same time, by the Australian Charles Leonard Hamblin.

In modern computer languages, the stack is usually implemented with more operations than just "push" and "pop". Some implementations have a function which returns the current length of the stack. Another typical helper operation is "top" (also known as "peek"), which can return the current top element of the stack without removing it. Another common operation is "dup," which makes a copy of the element at the top of the stack.


Nocturnal emission

Nocturnal emissions, wet dreams, sex dreams, and sleep orgasms all mean when person has a sexual orgasm while sleeping. It often leads to ejaculation. Wet dreams can begin after a person goes through puberty. Some young people have their first orgasm this way. According to one book, about 13% of boys had their first ejaculation through a wet dream. They might not understand what has happened to them, if they have not been taught anything about sex.

Nocturnal emissions are called wet dreams in males because of the dampness caused by ejaculation and because the orgasm and ejaculation often happen during a sexually exciting dream. Scientists are not sure what causes them. Most sexual dreams "do not" cause orgasms.

It is harder for women to tell, because vaginal lubrication is not always associated with orgasm.

Wet dreams are natural and harmless. They do not mean that anything is wrong with you. While it can feel almost magical to ejaculate during a dream, most boys don't like the mess it creates. Boys usually don't have wet dreams if they masturbate before sleeping every night. Many people stop having wet dreams if they masturbate often, or once they begin having sexual intercourse regularly. 

Dreams can be strange and confusing. Often it is best not to over-think about what they might mean. A dream about having sex with another boy or man does not necessarily mean you are gay. A sexual dream involving a relative or teacher does not mean you truly want to have sex with that person. A dream about sex with an animal does not mean you truly want to have sex with an animal.

If you urinate while asleep, this is called wetting the bed, not a wet dream. the 

Nocturnal emissions are mentioned in the bible in Deuteronomy 23:10 and Leviticus 15:16. Deuteronomy 23:10-11 says, "10: If any man among you becomes unclean because of a nocturnal emission, he must leave the camp and stay outside. 11: When evening approaches, he must wash with water, and when the sun sets he may return to the camp." (Berean Standard Bible)

Tevatron

The Tevatron was a giant Particle accelerator in Illinois that was used by scientists to make protons go very fast, almost the speed of light in some cases. Scientists looked at what happens when the protons hit antiprotons to see if they are right about their ideas as to what protons are made of.

The Tevatron was a circular particle accelerator at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (also known as Fermilab), just east of Batavia, Illinois. It was the second highest energy particle collider in the world after the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The Tevatron is a synchrotron that accelerates protons and antiprotons in a 6.28 km (3.90 miles) ring to energies of up to 1 TeV, hence its name. The Tevatron was completed in 1983 at a cost of $120 million ($ today) and has been regularly upgraded since then. (The 'Energy Doubler', as it was known then, produced its first accelerated beam — 512 GeV — on July 3, 1983.) The "Main Injector" was the most substantial addition, built over five years from 1994 at a cost of $290 million. The Tevatron was shut down on September 30, 2011.

The Large Hadron Collider was later built in Switzerland to look for one of those pieces, called the Higgs Boson. The LHC broke and is now being fixed. The Tevatron scientists also tried to find the Higgs Boson. They need to do this before the LHC is fixed, because the LHC is much better at finding things.

The scientists at the Tevatron had a year's headstart on the scientists at the LHC. Whoever finds the Higgs will be honored by other scientists. That is why the scientists at the Tevatron wanted to find it before the scientists at the LHC.

The Tevatron discovered three of the 17 fundamental particles including the top quark. The main ring of the Tevatron will probably be reused in future experiments, and its components may be transferred to other particle accelerators.

MOSFET

MOSFET stands for metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor. It is an electronic component that acts as an electrically controlled switch. 

Transistors are small electrical devices that are used in radios, calculators, and, perhaps most famously, computers; they are some of the most basic building blocks of modern electronic systems. A few MOSFETs amplify or process analog signals but most are used in digital electronics.

MOSFETs act like valves for electricity. They have one input connection (the "gate") which is used to control the flow of electricity between two other connections (the "source" and "drain"). Said another way, the gate acts as a switch that controls the two outputs. Think of a dimmable light switch: the knob itself selects 'ON', 'OFF', or somewhere in between, controlling the brightness of the light. Think of a MOSFET in place of the light switch: the switch itself is the "gate", the "source" is the power coming into the house, and the "drain" is the light bulb.

The name MOSFET describes the structure and the function of the transistor. MOS refers to the fact that a MOSFET is built by layering metal (the "gate") on oxide (an insulator which prevents the flow of electricity) on semiconductor (the "source" and "drain"). FET describes the action of the gate on the semiconductor. An electric signal is sent to the gate, which creates an electric field that alters the connection between the "source" and "drain".

Almost all MOSFETs are used in integrated circuits. As of 2008, it is possible to fit 2,000,000,000 transistors on a single integrated circuit. In 1970, that number was around 2,000.

There are four common types of MOSFET:

The enhancement mode N-Channel MOSFET, where the switch between the "source" and "drain" is usually off. You can turn the switch on by applying a positive voltage to the "gate", so it is at a higher voltage than the "source". The P-Channel MOSFET is also usually off, but you use a negative voltage to turn it on. The Depletion mode N and P-Channel MOSFET transistors are very similar to their enhancement mode counterparts, but they are normally on, and you use a negative or positive voltage to turn it off. The Depletion mode P-Channel MOSFET isn't normally available for use.

A small piece of silicon can have millions of MOSFETs created on it. This makes an integrated circuit. 

This section is about single MOSFETs with three connections.

If the MOSFET is partly on, it will reduce the power going through it. It does that by converting some power into heat. Even if it is on, it will still convert some power to heat. The MOSFET also has a resistance. When current flows from the MOSFET's drain to its source, there will be a voltage drop. Multiply that current, and the voltage, to get the power loss. That lost power becomes heat. The MOSFET must get rid of that heat, usually by passing it into the air. Smaller MOSFETs warm up and heat the nearby air, while some other MOSFETs must be on a circuit board, which has a larger area to heat more air. The highest-power MOSFETs must be under a heatsink.

There are lots of different MOSFETs available. When choosing a MOSFET, once you have decided among the 4 main types, there are lots of other things to think about. Differences between MOSFETs include:

There are many different ways to make MOSFETs on the semiconductor. The simplest method is shown in the diagram to the right of this text. The blue part represents P-type silicon, while the red part represents N-type silicon. The intersection of the two types makes a diode. In silicon semiconductor, there is a quirk called the "Depletion Region". In doped silicon, with one part being doped N-Type, and one part being doped P-Type, a depletion region will naturally form on the intersection between the two. This is because of their acceptors and donors. P-type silicon has acceptors, also known as holes, which attract electrons towards them. The N-Type silicon has donors, or electrons, which are attracted to holes. In the border between the two, the electrons from the N-Type fill the holes in the P-type. This results in the acceptor, or P-type atoms becoming negatively charged, and since negative charges attract positive charges, acceptors, or holes, will flow towards the "junction". On the N-Type side, there is a positive charge, which results in the donors, or electrons, flowing towards the "junction." When they get there, they will be repelled by the negative charge on the other side of the junction, since alike charges repel. The same will happen on the P-Type side, the donors, or holes will be repelled by the positive area in the N type side. No electricity can flow between the two, since no electrons can move to the other side.

MOSFETs use this to their advantage. The "Body" of the MOSFET is powered negatively, which widens the depletion region, since the holes are filled with the new electrons, so the opposite force to the electrons on the N side becomes much larger. The "Source" of the MOSFET is powered negatively, which shrinks the depletion zone in the N type entirely, since there are enough electrons to fulfill the positive depletion zone. The "Drain" has a positive power. When the "Gate" is supplied with positive power, it will make a small electromagnetic field, which will remove the depletion zone directly below the gate, since there will be a "spray" of holes, which will make something called an "N-Channel". The N-Channel is a temporary region of the P-Type silicon area where there is no depletion zone. The positive electric field will neutralize all of the spare electrons that make up the depletion zone. The electrons in the source area will then have a clear way to move to the "Drain", which would make electricity flow from source to drain.


First Punic War

The First Punic War started in 264 BC. It lasted for 23 years, ending in 241 BC. It was the first of three wars fought between ancient Carthage and the Roman Republic. They were rivals for trade and influence in the Mediterranean. For more than 20 years the two powers struggled for supremacy. Key areas were the island of Sicily and its surrounding waters, and also North Africa. Rome eventually won control of Sicily.

With the help of her own allies and rebels among the indigenous African allies of Carthage, Rome won the First Punic War after 23 years. In the end it became the dominant naval power of the Mediterranean. To get terms for peace, the Carthaginians had to pay a large amount of money (in silver), and give up a number of islands in the Mediterranean. They kept Sardinia and Corsica.

Scott Westerfeld

Scott Westerfeld (born May 5, 1963) is an American author of science fiction and young adult literature. One of his most famous book series was "Uglies".


The two books were re-published in 2005 in one volume, also titled "The Risen Empire".











Partial differential equation

Partial differential equations (abbreviated as PDEs) are a kind of mathematical equation. They are related to partial derivatives, in that obtaining an antiderivative of a partial derivative involves integration of partial differential equations.

Since PDEs have appeared in mathematics and physics, many scientists have studied methods to solve them. But unfortunately, no one could establish methods to solve any kind of PDE. Therefore, numerical methods for PDEs (such as the finite element method) are widely studied since the appearance of computers.



Trade paperback (comics)

Trade paperbacks, or "trades" as they are commonly called, are collections of comic books that are usually bound in a better format than the comic magazines, using the same materials and methods as printed books. They are generally sold in bookstores and specialty comic book shops rather than at newsstands. 

Unlike graphic novels, the material in a trade paperback is reprinted from comic magazines that were released in the standard 32-page format. Unlike comic books, which only tell one small part of a story, trade paperbacks usually collect a complete story, story arc, or a large part of a story. They usually reprint the material from 4 to 12 comic books, depending on the size of the trade and the story being collected.

Some famous examples of trade paperbacks:

Mathematical induction

Mathematical induction is a special way of proving a mathematical truth. It can be used to prove that something is true for all the natural numbers (or all positive numbers from a point onwards). The idea is that if:


then

In the careful language of mathematics, a proof by induction often proceeds as follows:

Because it is true for 1, then it is true for 1+1 (=2, by the induction step), then it is true for 2+1 (=3), then it is true for 3+1 (=4), and so on.

Prove that for all natural numbers "n":

Proof:

First, the statement can be written as:

By induction on "n",

First, for "n"=1:

so this is true.

Next, assume that for some "n"="n" the statement is true. That is,:

Then for "n"="n"+1:

can be rewritten as

Since formula_12

Hence the proof is complete by induction.

Mathematical induction is often stated with the starting value 0 (rather than 1). In fact, it will work just as well with a variety of starting values. Here is an example when the starting value is 3: "The sum of the interior angles of a formula_1-sided polygon is formula_15 degrees."

The initial starting value is 3, and the interior angles of a triangle is formula_16 degrees. Assume that the interior angles of a formula_1-sided polygon is formula_15 degrees. Add on a triangle which makes the figure a formula_5-sided polygon, and that increases the count of the angles by 180 degrees formula_20 degrees. Since both the base case and the inductive case are handled, the proof is now complete.

There are a great many mathematical objects for which proofs by mathematical induction works. The technical term is a "well-ordered set".

The same idea can work to "define" a set of objects, as well as to prove statements about that set of objects.

For example, we can define formula_1th degree cousin as follows:

There is a set of axioms for the arithmetic of the natural numbers which is based on mathematical induction. This is called "Peano's Axioms". The undefined symbols are | and =.The axioms are

One can then define the operations of addition and multiplication and so on by mathematical induction. For example:



Kader Abdolah

Hossein Sadjadi Ghaemmaghami Farahani (, better known by his pen name Kader Abdolah () (Arak, 12 November 1954), is a Dutch author who was born in Iran.

Kader Abdolah was born "Hossein Sadjadi Ghaemmaghami Farahani" () in Arak, Iran. Since 1988 he has been living in the Netherlands.

His books are often written in Dutch. He adds ideas from Persian literature. He wrote "De reis van de lege flessen", "The journey of the empty bottles". The book is about an Iranian who goes to live in the Netherlands. "The House of the Mosque" was voted second best Dutch novel ever in Holland. "My Father's Notebook: A Novel of Iran" and "The House of the Mosque" are available in English.


Wigan

Wigan is a town located within the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan in Greater Manchester, North West England. It is home to Wigan Athletic football club and Wigan Warriors rugby league team. It is about twenty miles from Liverpool, Manchester and Preston.

Polymerization

Polymerization or polymerisation is the process in which small molecules, called monomers, join chemically to produce a very large chain-like or network molecules, called polymers. The monomer molecules may all be alike, or they may represent two, three, or more different compounds. Usually at least 100 monomer molecules must be combined to make a product that has certain unique physical properties—such as elasticity, high tensile strength, or the ability to form fibres—that differentiate polymers from substances composed of smaller and simpler molecules. Often, many thousands of monomer units are in a single molecule of a polymer. The formation of stable covalent chemical bonds between the monomers sets polymerization apart from other processes, such as crystallization, in which large numbers of molecules aggregate under the influence of weak intermolecular forces. Alkene molecules can react with themselves, by adding polymerization to form 'plastic' or polymeric materials. When a catalyst (a substance that speeds up chemical processes) is added to the reaction, or it is heated under pressure, unsaturated alkenes link together, when the double bond partially breaks.

Polyethene is a cheap and useful plastic used for plastic bags and bottles, it is also very flexible and quite strong.

Final Crisis

Final Crisis is was a seven issue miniseries published by DC Comics from May 2008 to January 2009 written by Grant Morrison and drawn by JG Jones, Carlos Pacheco and Doug Mahnke.

In "Final Crisis", the bad guys win. But after some fighting, Superman deep freezes the Earth's population. After he defeats a vampire god called the Dark Monitor, he brings the world back with his imagination.

Portishead

"This article is about the town. For the band with the same name, see Portishead (band)."
Portishead is a town near the sea in North Somerset, England, where about 21000 people live (Local council update July 24, 2007).

Portishead has had a history since Roman times. Its name comes from the words ‘port at the head of the river’. The town was built on the mouth of a small river; the main road in the town once met the water at the top of the river.

Lots of buildings in the town are of a Victorian style.

In the 1860s, in the middle of the iron and steel era, a pier and a dock were built for the big boats that could not easily get to Bristol Harbour. The ships brought in expensive items from around the world and took items made in the town to other countries. Many ships carried coal.

In the 1880s Portishead Dock was bought by Bristol Corporation, and was managed as part of the Port of Bristol until it closed.

The Portishead power stations were coal power stations built near the dock. The first power station was built in 1926. It began making electricity in 1929 for the Bristol Corporation. The power station was made bigger in 1948.

A 2nd power station was started in 1949 and began making electricity in 1955.

After 1949, the power stations became part of the country's electricity industry. They used some local coal produced in the Somerset coalfield which was moved by train along the Portishead Railway. The line had opened on 12 April 1867 as the Bristol and Portishead Pier and Railway Company; it opened to the dock on 5 July 1879.

The 1st power station closed in 1976, and the 2nd closed in 1982. The dock was closed in 1992.

Portishead had two train stations for people who lived in the town. The main station was near the centre of Portishead, and the other was at the Pier. The construction of the 2nd power station caused the 1st train station to be removed and another station was opened in the main street of the town on 2 January 1954. The new station closed on 7 September 1964. People who live in Portishead now want the train station to be opened again.



Okashina Okashi

Okashina Okashi - Strange Candy is a webcomic drawn by Emily Snodgrass (Emi-chan) and written by Allison Brownlow (Tanzy), Karen Olympia (Kourin), and J. Baird (Xuanwu). It started in 2001, with Brownlow as its first writer and Olympia added to the team in October 2001. Snodgrass has appeared at conventions (large groups of people with a common interest), speaking as an amateur artist answering questions from an audience. Snodgrass is an amateur artist who does not earn a living from her online comic.

"Okashina Okashi" is hosted on Comic Genesis, a free online provider of webcomics. Baird used his comics while teaching for Hess Educational Organization, an English education business in the Republic of China and Singapore. He used "Okashina Okashi" in the "Create a Comic Project" when he volunteered to teach a free after-school youth literacy library event in New Haven, CT.

In August 2007, Emi-chan added a new comic set in the Beauty Man Garden, a chain of restaurants featured prominently throughout "Okashina Okashi". The new comic is called "Mini BMG".

A group of people who don't know each other are sucked into a different universe called UberTokyo. They must try to find a way home by using "plotholes" (holes in the air) to move between worlds. Each world is a parody of a kind of anime and manga, such as sports, sentai, and fantasy. The stories from beginning to present are:


In addition to these stories, there are many smaller stories. The longest small story has Kerisu, an evil overlord, who needs new servants and wants the main cast to replace them. Ho-chan and Daisuke, who were left behind in the sentai adventure world, have been seen again a number of times for their own small story. A third small story has Professor Li and his assistant Terra.

The comic features a large number of references to many anime and video games, such as Neon Genesis Evangelion, Revolutionary Girl Utena, and Guilty Gear. It also uses male homoeroticism as fanservice. One of its important male characters, Eeichi, is bisexual. Another male character, Takeshi, frequently cross dresses. Two less important female characters, Jen Puni and Zuga Ma, are hinted to be lesbians.


















Adverse possession

Adverse possession is a rule in property law. This rule says that if property is not being used by its owner while another person is using the property, this other person (called an "adverse possessor") becomes the new owner of the property. To get these rights, the adverse possessor usually must use the property in the way a normal owner would do for a period of time, typically 20 years. In some jurisdictions, a form of adverse possession exists in which the adverse possessor ends up with sharing some rights to property with the owner, such as a right-of-way, instead of getting all the rights.

Rule against perpetuities

The Rule against Perpetuities is one of the most complicated rules in property law and wills and trusts. In general, the rule states that a gift of a will (or a trust) will not be enforced if the subject of the gift is to be given to a person who can not be known now, and will not be able to be known, by the end of 21 years after the death of everyone who was alive (including children in their mother's uterus but not yet born) at the time the gift was created. 

For example, if a woman says in her will that her house is to be given "to the children of her children when they graduate from college" this would not be enforced by a court. It would not be enforced because one (or more) of her children's children might not graduate from college until 21 years after everyone who was alive at the time of the woman's death has died. 

The purpose of the rule is to prevent property from being tied up for "perpetuity" (a very long time). The courts (and many people in society) do not want to hold property to see who will receive it after a complicated set of rules from the gift-giver. First, this would result in a waste of the courts' time and resources. Second, it would be a waste of the property that is being given through the gift. If a gift in a will violates the Rule against Perpetuities, the court will simply strike that gift and transfer the subject of the gift as if the will had not mentioned it.

However, many countries and states have changed this rule, and it does not apply at all, or in a changed way, in those countries and states.

Polypeptide

A polypeptide is a string or linear chain of amino acids linked together. Amino acids are the basic building blocks of proteins. A single polypeptide chain might make up the entire primary structure of a simple protein; more complex proteins are formed when two or more polypeptides link together. Each protein is a polymer of amino acids.

Polypeptides are made when mRNA is translated, a process involving ribosomes, tRNA and amino acids.

Solipsism

Solipsism ( ) is the view that a person has no reason to believe anything exists except their own mind. It is a theory that first appeared in ancient philosophy. It mainly means to reject or doubt that other people exist. "" and "" are the Latin words for "alone" and "self", which is where the word "solipsism" comes from. Some kinds of solipsism say that everything outside a person's own mind (including other people) is only imaginary. Other kinds of solipsism instead say that nothing outside a person's own mind is certain.

Denial of material existence, in itself, is not solipsism. Solipsism also rejects or doubts that other people exist. As an epistemological view, it is the concept that nothing but one's own mind can be "certain" to exist. The existence of other minds, in this view, is considered a possibility, but not certainty. And even time does not stop just because there would be nobody to experience it (which is probably going to happen in the end of the universe when there would be simply nothing)


SS Nomadic

SS "Nomadic" is a steamship of the White Star Line, launched on 25 April 1911 in Belfast. She was built as a to the liners RMS "Olympic" and RMS "Titanic", and is the last remaining boat built for the White Star Line still afloat.

The of "Nomadic" was laid down in the shipyards, Belfast in 1910 (yard number 422). She was launched on 25 April 1911 and delivered to the White Star Line on the 27 May. The ship was 67 meters (220 ft) long and 11.3 meters (37 ft) wide, with a of 1,273 tons. She had two three-bladed screws, with a maximum speed of 12 knots.

With her sister ship , "Nomadic" was used as a tender for "Titanic" and "Olympic" at Cherbourg in France. This meant she would ferry the passengers from Cherbourg to "Titanic" "Olympic" as they were too big to fit into the port at Cherbourg. "Nomadic" was fitted with a luxurious interior and was used for the first and second class passengers, whilst "Traffic" served the third class travellers.

During World War I "Nomadic" saw service in carrying American troops at Brest (France).

In 1927, she was sold to Compagnie Cherbourghoise de Transbordement and then sold again to the Société Cherbourghoise de Remorquage et de Sauvetage in 1934. Then under the name "Ingenieur Minard", she again served as troop ship in World War II.

After the war she continued tendering Cunard White Star (White Star Lines and "Cunard" merged in 1934) ships until November 1968. She then served for the last time.

In 1974, "Nomadic" was bought by a private individual and converted into a restaurant on the Seine in Paris, where she remained docked and semi-abandoned after the closure of the restaurant, until she was moved to the port of Le Havre in 2003.

A public appeal for donations to return "Nomadic" to the Harland and Wolff shipyard for restoration was organised by Belfast Industrial Heritage, a non-profit organisation in Northern Ireland in collaboration with enthusiasts through the SaveNomadic.com Appeal.

On 26 January 2006, SS "Nomadic" was purchased at auction in Paris by the Department for Social Development, part of the Northern Ireland Office. She cost £171,320 (the reserve price being £165,000).

SS "Nomadic" left Le Havre to return to Belfast on 12 July, and arrived back close to where she was built on 18 July 2006. She was welcomed back by the Social Development Minister MP and the Deputy Lord Mayor of the City of Belfast, Councillor Ruth Patterson and a number of well wishers. The "Nomadic" arrived "piggy backed" on a marine transportation barge, which had been contracted from Anchor Marine Transportation Limited.

A study by Belfast City Council estimated the cost of restoring "Nomadic" at £7 million. Belfast Harbour Commissioners have agreed to provide a temporary berth for the ship, and a charitable trust to co-ordinate fundraising for the restoration has been set up. Now that the vessel is on the United Kingdom's National Register of Historic Vessels, the project should qualify for a National Lottery grant application, which should greatly enhance existing funds of £60,000 from a public appeal and £100,000 from .

The Nomadic Appeal Public Website founded the Nomadic Preservation Society.

On her return to Belfast, SS "Nomadic" was moored at Queen's Quay just outside the in Belfast and opened with a temporary exhibition. In late 2008 the ship was closed to the public and moved to Barnett's Dock for internal maintenance. It is expected she will soon enter Hamilton Graving Dock for drydocking and complete restoration.

In January 2009, the company Frazer-Nash was appointed to manage the Conservation Management Plan. The level of restoration will then be decided.

It was planned that the restoration of SS "Nomadic" will be completed in time for the 100th anniversary of the sinking of "Titanic" in 2012.



Dipstick

A dipstick is a tool which can be dipped into liquid to measure how much of it there is, or to test it for things.

A testing dipstick is usually made of paper or cardboard. It contains substances which change colour when something is found in a liquid.

Measuring dipsticks show the amount of liquid in a container. These containers are usually hard to access. Measuring dipsticks are used by inserting and removing the stick and then checking how much of the stick is covered by the liquid. The oil level dipstick is an example of a measuring dipstick found on most internal combustion engines.

Elliptic curve

An elliptic curve is a curve of degree 3 that can be described using the following formula:

formula_1,

where formula_2 and formula_3 are integers.

Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit

The Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit, also called the Stealth Bomber, is an American strategic bomber. It has a lot of stealth technology, and it is designed to get through many anti-aircraft defenses. It can drop both conventional and nuclear weapons. Two people fly the bomber, and it can drop up to 80 -class JDAM GPS-guided bombs, or sixteen B83 nuclear bombs. 

The bomber began being designed as the "Advanced Technology Bomber" (ATB) during the Carter administration. The designing of the ATB continued during the Reagan administration. The bomber was designed and is made by Northrop Grumman, with help from Boeing. Each aircraft cost US$737 million (in 1997 dollars). 

Because the bomber is very expensive, the project was controversial in the U.S. Congress. The end of the Cold War meant that the bomber was not really needed anymore. Congress wanted to buy 132 bombers, but during the late 1980s and 1990s, Congress reduced this to 21. In 2008, a B-2 was destroyed in a crash shortly after takeoff. The crew got out safely. 20 B-2s are being used by the United States Air Force. 

Although the B-2 was supposed to be a mainly nuclear bomber, it was first used in combat to drop normal bombs on Serbia during the Kosovo War in 1999. It was used during the Iraq War and it was used in the war in Afghanistan.

In 2023, it landed for the first time on the European mainland; The plane is expected to leave Norway after training with air forces in Europe.


Diapause

Diapause is a delay in development which has evolved in response to regular periods of adverse environmental conditions.

It is a physiological state with very specific conditions. Diapause is a mechanism used as a means to survive predictable, unfavourable environmental conditions, such as temperature extremes, drought or reduced food availability. It is most often observed in arthropods, especially insects, and in the embryos of many of the oviparous species of fish in the order Cyprinodontiformes.

Not only is diapause started by specific stimuli or conditions, but once it is started, only certain other stimuli are capable of bringing the organism out of diapause. This distinguishes diapause from other forms of dormancy such as hibernation.

Activity levels of diapausing stages can vary considerably among species. Diapause may occur in a completely immobile stage, such as the pupae and eggs, or it may occur in very active stages that undergo extensive migrations, such as the adult Monarch butterfly, "Danaus plexippus". In cases where the insect remains active, feeding is reduced and reproductive development is slowed or halted.

Electric field

An electric field is a vector field that shows the direction that a positively charged particle will move when placed in the field. More precisely, if a particle has an electric charge formula_1 and is in an electric field formula_2, the electric force the charge will feel is formula_3. Electric fields are produced around objects that have electrical charge, or by a magnetic field that changes with time. Electric field lines are used to represent the influence of electric field. The idea of an electric field was first made by Michael Faraday.

Electric fields are caused by electric charges, described by Gauss's law, or varying magnetic fields, described by Faraday's law of induction. The equations of both fields are coupled and together form Maxwell's equations that describe both fields as a function of charges and currents.

Audiobook

Audiobooks or "talking books" are books that have been read aloud by someone and recorded. Nowadays, they are usually recorded onto compact discs (CDs), although some older editions remain on cassette tapes. (This is why many texts in this format were first called books-on-tape.) More recently, audiobooks have been available to download from the internet (free or paid-for) and pre-recorded on special MP3 players.

While audiobooks can be used by anyone, they serve as a main resource for people who are blind or cannot see well.

Many popular books are often chosen to be turned into audiobooks. The original author may or may not be involved in choosing the narrator for the reading. Some authors often use the same reader for many books, so that their audiobooks have a similar sound or style.

Power spectrum

The power spectrum of a signal is the power or more simply the energy of the signal at each frequency that it contains. It can also be considered as the range or spectra of energy or power of the given signal derived from the signals' range of frequencies. For example, white noise, which contains all frequencies at the same power, has a flat power spectrum. The power spectrum of the sound of the bottom key on a piano would have a high value at the frequency corresponding to its note, and low values elsewhere.

Potato gun

A potato gun or Potato cannon is a type of cannon that uses combustion or air pressure to fire a projectile. They are called potato guns because potatoes are a commonly used projectile.

There are two main types of potato guns. Combustion guns use a flammable fuel and igniter to move an object. Another type uses compressed air. Potato guns are usually built of PVC or ABS (a type of plastic) piping. If using air to power your potato cannon you need around 50 to 70 psi to shoot a potato.

Combustion potato guns have 4 parts. These are the barrel, combustion chamber, a cap, and an igniter.


A potato cannon can move a 2" diameter potato projectile over 100 yards at a speed of 40 mph. This makes potato guns dangerous.



A air powered potato cannon is much stronger than a combustion cannon. A combustion potato gun will launch projectiles at a pressure of about 10-20 psi. Air powered guns often use pressures over 100 psi.

Parsec

A parsec is a unit of distance used in astronomy. It is the distance that light travels in 3.26 years, or just under 31 trillion kilometres (about 19 trillion miles). 

This is from the definition: a parsec is the distance from the Sun to an object which has a parallax angle of one arcsecond. The technique used in the calculation is trigonometry. 

It takes 3.26 years for the light to come from a parsec away.

Deterministic algorithm

A deterministic algorithm is a computer science term. Functions are deterministic when if you never change what you give it (the input), that what you get out (the output) never changes either; and you can do this as many times as you want.

Puget Sound

Puget Sound is a sound in northwestern Washington State. It is a large area of salt water that is partially cut off from the rest of the Pacific Ocean. Many of Washington's cities, like Seattle and Tacoma are next to the sound. Many boats and ships travel on the sound. Some of the ships are ferries which take people and cars from the main part of Washington to the islands in the sound and to the Olympic Peninsula. Many ships come from across the ocean from places like Japan and China to trade in Washington.

The Legacy of Heorot

The Legacy of Heorot is a science fiction novel written in 1987 by Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle and Steven Barnes.

This is the first book in the "Heorot" series. It is about a human space colony at the star Tau Ceti.

Hundreds of years in the future, people travel to the star Tau Ceti. It takes 100 years to fly there. To live that long the people go to sleep and freeze each other. When they get there they unfreeze, but some people do not wake up. Some people wake up but are not as smart as they were.

They land on the fourth planet from the sun and build a town on a big island. Everything is peaceful until they are attacked by a large animal. The animal is like a cross between a frog and an alligator. It is big but also "very" fast and smart. They call it a Grendel. The Grendel kills several people but then it is killed.

The people get very scared and build fences, land mines, and guns. After a while they get less scared and think that the Grendel they killed was the only one. They build boats and get brave. Then another bigger Grendel kills some of the people in the boats. The People trap and kill this Grendel.

The People get really mad. They find out that Grendels have to stay near water because when a Grendel moves fast it makes a lot of heat. If it does not cool off it will die. They go all around the island and kill all the Grendels. This makes them very happy.

They feel safe and travel all around the island. They notice that the alien fish are big now. They think that without the Grendels around there will be lots of fish to eat. This makes them happy.

Everything is good until the fish get very big. When they get big enough they grow legs, breath air, and move very fast. The fish are "baby Grendels". Now instead of a few big Grendels there are thousands of small ones.

Some people escape to the space ship. But, other stay to defend the town. They use the electric fences and land mines and guns to kill the little Grendels. After awhile the town gets too damaged to protect anymore. The people run away to a cave on a mountain. The Grendels follow them up a river and attack the cave. The people use kerosene to burn the Grendels. Also, they knock big rocks down onto them. After enough Grendels get killed, the other Grendels learn to run away instead of just attack. The people "win".

Over time the people hunt down all the new Grendels and all the alien fish. Finally they are safe.

Xkcd

xkcd is a comic strip on the Internet. American cartoonist Randall Munroe draws and writes the comic. The comic is drawn in boxes. It is one of the most popular comics on the Internet. It is "a webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math and language". Sometimes, the readers of the comic act out things that Munroe puts in his comics. There are also messages in all comics that show up when moused over. In October 2007, the comic was viewed about 60 million times. The comic has won many awards. The name "xkcd" does not mean anything and was just made so people do not say it as a word. , there are over 2900 different "xkcd" comics.

In November 2015, Munroe wrote a book named "Thing Explainer", using the same stick figure drawings from his comic. The book is about how things work, and is written in Simple English. It uses only one thousand different simple words. The idea for it came from a comic "Up goer Five" which is about the Saturn V rocket.

University College London

University College London (UCL) is a large university in London. It is the largest college of the federal University of London. As well as undergraduate teaching, it is one of the largest research universities in the country.

UCL was founded in 1826 as 'University College'. It was the first university institution to be founded in London and the first in England to be established on an entirely secular (non-religious) basis. It admits students regardless of their religious beliefs. UCL was also the first admit women on equal terms with men. University College became one of the two founding colleges of the University of London in 1836.

UCL has over 100 departments, institutes and research centres in eight faculties. Its main campus is in the Bloomsbury area of central London. There are also a number of institutes and teaching hospitals elsewhere in central London.

It has grown through mergers. These include the Institute of Neurology (in 1997), the Royal Free Hospital Medical School (in 1998), the Eastman Dental Institute (in 1999), the School of Slavonic and East European Studies (in 1999), the School of Pharmacy (in 2012) and the Institute of Education (in 2014).

The original University College was based largely on ideas of Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832), a lawyer, social philosopher and free-thinker. Bentham believed in libertarianism, utilitarianism, women's suffrage, and the separation of church and state. These are beliefs of liberalism. The college was unique in that it was secular, and was called "that Godless institution in Gower Street".

University College was founded on 11 February 1826, under the name "London University", as a secular alternative to the strictly Anglican universities of Oxford and Cambridge. It was founded from the beginning as a university, not a college or institute.

However, its founders got such strong opposition from the Church of England that it prevented them from getting the Royal Charter needed for the award of degrees. King's College London was specifically founded to provide an Anglican rival to UCL. It was not until 1836, when the latter-day University of London was established, that University College was legally recognised and granted the power to award degrees of the University of London.

UCL has over 7,000 academic and research staff and 840 professors, the highest number of any British university. There are currently 56 Fellows of the Royal Society, 51 Fellows of the British Academy, 15 Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering and 121 Fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences amongst UCL academic and research staff.

UCL is a major centre for biomedical research; it is part of three of the 12 biomedical research centres established by the NHS in England and is a founding member of UCL Partners, the largest academic health science centre in Europe.

For the period 1999 to 2009 it was the 13th most-cited university in the world (and the most-cited in Europe). There has been at least one Nobel Prize winner from UCL every decade since the establishment of the Nobel Prizes in 1901. There are 29 Nobel Prize winners and three Fields Medalists amongst UCL’s alumni and current and former staff, the most recent being Sir Charles Kao, who received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.

According to a ranking of universities produced by SCImago Research Group, UCL is ranked 12th in the world (and 1st in Europe) in terms of total research output. According to data released in July 2008 by ISI Web of Knowledge, UCL is the 13th most-cited university in the world (and most-cited in Europe). The analysis covered citations from 1 January 1998 to 30 April 2008, during which 46,166 UCL research papers attracted 803,566 citations. The report covered citations in 21 subject areas and the results revealed some of UCL's key strengths, including: Clinical Medicine (1st outside North America); Immunology (2nd in Europe); Neuroscience & Behaviour (1st outside North America and 2nd in the world); Pharmacology & Toxicology (1st outside North America and 4th in the world); Psychiatry & Psychology (2nd outside North America); and Social Sciences, General (1st outside North America).

UCL is a member of the G5, the League of European Research Universities, the Russell Group, and other national and international groups. It forms part of the 'Golden Triangle' of British universities.


Carnegie Mellon University

Carnegie Mellon University is a research university. It is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is known for research in computer science. It is ranked #1 in the United States for computer science.

Migraine

A migraine is a medical condition which usually causes a pounding, throbbing headache on one side of the head. The pain may be very bad and hurt so much that a person may have a hard time doing anything. While most people who have migraines get a headache, not everyone does. There are different kinds of migraines, and some do not cause a headache but do have other symptoms.

Most migraines cause a headache and nausea and might make the person dizzy or very sensitive to bright lights or loud noises. Some people have "auras" before a migraine starts, which means their ability to see becomes different. They may see funny patterns, have blurry vision, or may not be able to see at all. Other senses can change before or during a migraine, and the person may sense funny smells or tastes. Migraines can last a long time. Migraines usually last between four and 72 hours.

Migraines have been classified, based on how often they happen in a month: If a person has a headache for less than fifteen days, the migraine is called "episodic migraine" (EM). If it happens more than fifteen days, it is called "chronic migraine" (CM). Chronic means it happens over a long amount of time. Some people who start off getting episodic migraines may start to get "chronic migraines" later. Chronic migraine then may "revert" or go back to episodic migraine.

Scientists have discovered that something called CGRP is the cause of migraines. CGRP stands for "calcitonin gene-related peptide". CGRP is a protein that causes migraines when it is released around the brain. What CGRP does, is that it causes a lot of inflammation in the meninges, a covering above the brain.

There are different risk factors which make a person more likely to have migraines. Being a female is a risk factor, and so is having family members who had migraines. For a person who has migraines, there are different trigger factors which may set off a migraine attack. In a large group of females who have migraines, one of the main trigger factors is when the amount of the hormone estrogen in their body either drops too low or "fluctuates" (goes up and down).

The World Health Organization says that migraine headache is the most costly brain problem for treatment and disability in the European Union and the United States.



"Childhood periodic syndromes" are a group of migraine syndromes that children may have. When a child has one of these child periodic syndromes there is a greater chance that they will get one of the other, more common types of migraines when they become adults.

Abdominal migraine is a kind of migraine which causes a very bad pain in the area of the abdomen, usually around the 'belly-button' which is called the "periumbilical area". Abdominal migraine usually affects children starting at about age 7, but it may affect younger children and older children, and it may also sometimes affect adults.

Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (BPVC for short): (this means harmless dizziness, that happens again and again and happens suddenly) is a medical condition which occurs in children usually starting between two and five years of age; it often disappears by the age of eight. BPVC causes vertigo.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome or cyclical vomiting syndrome (CVS), is a medical condition whose main symptoms are nausea and repeated vomiting. CVS happens more often in children, but it can occur at any age.

Episodic migraine (EM) is when a person has migraine symptoms for 14 days or less in one month, while chronic migraine (CM) is when a person has migraine symptoms for 15 or more days in one month. When compared to persons with episodic migraine, those with CM where less likely to have full-time jobs and had a larger risk of headache-related disability. Persons with CM are almost twice as likely to have anxiety, chronic pain, and/or depression; they also have a 40% greater chance of having heart disease and angina and are 70% more likely to have a history of stroke.

About 7.68% of total migraine cases are chronic migraines and about 1% of people in the United States have CM, with a higher rate among females, middle-aged people, and in those households that had the lowest annual income. (The American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention Study)
Aura (from the Greek word for breeze) is the word used to describe a series of neurological symptoms that may begin before an epileptic seizure or a migraine headache. About 15% of people who have a migraine will have the kind with an aura. The symptoms may include visual problems such as "scotomas" (losing vision for a short time, seeing zig-zag lines or floating spots etc.), vertigo, a ringing noise in the ears (tinnitus) and problems speaking.
Scotoma (came from the Greek word for darkness: "skotos"): a "blind spot" or area of reduced vision surrounded by a normal visual field. i.e.: A person can see normally except where the scotoma is. Scotomas may affect one or both eyes and be either and be either "absolute" where nothing can be seen within the scotoma or, "relative" with some ability to see within the area of the scotoma.

Scotomas may also have different patterns and shapes like the "fortification" scotoma; it is called fortification because it looks like the outline of an old fort. Scotomas can start of small and then get bigger, move around to different parts of a person's visual field, and they can also look like flickering lights.

In medicine a "factor" is a substance, a condition or an activity, or a lack thereof that increases the chance of a certain outcome or condition happening. If it increases the chance of something unhealthy it is a "risk factor". A "trigger factor" or 'trigger' for short is a factor that may cause an activity or the signs and/or symptoms of a medical condition to begin.


There are no specific tests to diagnose migraine but a doctor may use different tests to rule out other causes for a person's symptoms. The diagnosis of migraine is a "clinical diagnosis" which means it is based upon a person's "medical history" that a person reports to the doctor. The medical history for a possible migraine diagnosis which can be called the "headache history" includes information such as:

"Differential diagnoses" are different medical disorders which may cause the same symptoms. Before a doctor makes a "final diagnosis", which means they are sure of what medical disorder is causing the problem, they think of what other medical conditions have the same or almost the same symptoms, and make sure it's not one of them.

Often, having one medical condition makes it more likely a person will also have one or more other medical or psychiatric disorders. These other disorders are the "comorbid disorders" or "comorbidities". There are various comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions associated with migraines. The treatment and "prognosis" (if a disease gets better, worse or stays the same over time) of migraine is affected by the comorbid disorders which may be present and/or the chance of getting comorbid disorders.<br>

Comorbid psychiatric conditions

In medicine, a complication is a problem that happens because of, a procedure (like surgery), treatment (like medication), or illness (like migraines).

In medicine "epidemiology" is the study of what causes diseases and medical conditions, how often they happen, where they happen and who they happen to.

Migraine is more common among boys than girls until the beginning of puberty when girls start getting migraines more often than boys. By the later part of the teenage years girls get migraines almost twice as much as boys do. The number of people who get migraines is highest between the ages of 25 to 55 years in both men and women, after which, the risk of getting migraines get lower as a person gets older.

Between 65-75% of adult migraine sufferers are women and of these women, about two-thirds have menstrual migraines. Migraines are more common in people who make less money, there may be different reasons why such as stress.

About two-thirds of migraines are migraines without aura and the remaining one-third of cases are migraine with aura.
Symptoms that mimic those of migraines have been recorded in various cultures throughout written history. The first known mention was found on cuneiform tablets from Babylonia dating to 2000-1880 B.C.E. A treatment for migraine can be found in the "Ebers Papyrus", an Ancient Egyptian medical text named after George Ebers, the German Eygptologist who discovered them. In the ancient text dated to 1552 B.C.E. migraine is refereed to as "suffering in half the head".

The Ancient Greek physician Aretaeus of Cappadocia's description of a type of headache he dubbed "heterocrania" is considered a description of migraine.

Josh Groban

Joshua Winslow "Josh" Groban (born February 27, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, actor, and record producer. He has won many Tony and Grammy awards throughout his career, including one for Natasha, Pierre and the great Comet of 1812. He is playing Sweeney Todd now.
Groban was born in Los Angeles, California, to Jack Groban, a businessman, and Lindy Groban (née Johnston), a school teacher. His father is a descendant of Jewish immigrants from Poland and Ukraine, but converted from Judaism to Christianity upon marrying his mother. His mother's ancestry includes English, German, and Norwegian; one of her own grandfathers had also been Jewish. His parents are Episcopalians.

Groban first sang in public when he was in the seventh grade. His music teacher chose him to sing a solo of "S'wonderful" at the school's cabaret night, where he sang alone on stage for the first time. At this time, he was more focused on acting, playing Tevye in his high school's production of "Fiddler on the Roof". In the summers of 1997 and 1998, he also attended the Interlochen Center for the Arts Camp in Michigan, majoring in musical theater, and began taking vocal lessons. He went on to attend the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts as a theater major and graduated in 1999. He was admitted to and briefly attended Carnegie Mellon University, intent on studying musical theater. Four months into his first semester, Groban was offered a recording contract and left college to pursue a singing career.
He is playing Sweeney Todd, and he claims to be a pescetarian… because of meat pies

Network bridge

A network bridge is a device which connects two parts of a network together at the data link layer (layer 2 of the OSI model). 

Network bridges work similarly to network switches, but the traffic is managed differently. A bridge will only send traffic from one side to the other if it is going to a destination on the other side. This is different to a layer 1 switch which sends all traffic from either side. Sometimes network bridges are called layer 2 switches. 

Since they need to look at the contents of the traffic going into them, they are much more complicated than a hub or repeater.

Network Switches and Bridges are both Layer 2 devices. They operate at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI Reference Model. Network Switches and Bridges have many similarities and similar function. But Switches are considered as superior devices than bridges.

Following are the major differences between network switches and bridges.

• Packet forwarding in Bridges are performed using software. Packet forwarding in Switches are performed using ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits).

• Switches operate comparatively higher speeds that Bridges.

• Method of switching of a Bridge is store and forward. Method of switching of a Switch can be store and forward, cut-through or fragment-free.

• Normally a Switch has more ports than a Bridge.

• Bridges can operate only in half duplex mode, but a Switch can operate both in half duplex or full duplex mode.

• Both Bridge and Switch has one collision domain per port, but switches have one broadcast domain per VLAN.

• Switches support full-duplex Local Area Network (LAN) communication.

Great Northern War

The Great Northern War (1700–1721), was a war fought between Sweden and the coalition of Russia, Saxony, Poland, and Denmark-Norway. In 1715 Prussia and Hannover joined the war against Sweden. The King of Hannover was also King George II of Great Britain.

After the coalition attacked them, Sweden invaded Russia in 1709 which was not a good idea. The Russian Army retreated so the Swedish Army had to chase them. When winter came it was the coldest winter that Europe had had in a hundred years and half of the Swedish soldiers died in the cold. Eventually the Swedish army caught up to the Russian army and they had a battle, called the battle of Poltava. Russia won the battle but most of the Swedish soldiers, including king Charles XII of Sweden, escaped and went to the Ottoman Empire. Peter, the king of Russia, didn't like this so he declared war on the Ottoman Empire. He lost and had to give the town of Azov back to the Ottomans.

Charles XII left the Ottoman Empire in 1714 and went to Stralsund in Pomerania which was owned by Sweden at the time but was under siege. Charles escaped back to Sweden just before the people in Stralsund surrendered. Then he invaded Norway (which was owned by Denmark at the time.) and was shot and killed there. With their king gone, the Swedish soldiers left Norway and went back to Sweden. On the way back many soldiers died.

When all that was happening Russia had been invading Sweden. Russia conquered Estonia, Livonia and Ingria. By the time the remaining soldiers had come back from Norway, Russia had completely conquered Finland. Sweden still didn't want peace though, because they would have to give lots of land to Russia. Russia used a newly made fleet of ships to attack and raid the Swedish Coast and Sweden would still not give up. Eventually the Russian and Swedish ships came together in the Battle of Grengam. Both sides thought they had won the battle so no treaty was signed until the Russians continued using their boats to damage the Swedish coast. Finally Sweden gave up in 1721. Sweden had made peace with Denmark in 1720 and in 1721 Sweden signed the treaty of Nystad.

In the Treaty of Nystad Sweden had to give land to other countries. Sweden had to give Estonia, Livonia and Ingria to Russia but could keep Finland. Sweden also signed other treaties. These were the treaty of Stockholm where Sweden gave Prussia Swedish Pomerania and the treaty of Fredericksborg where Sweden had to pay Denmark-Norway money for the damage the war had done.

This war was significant because it allowed Russia to become the dominant power in Northeastern Europe, instead of Sweden.

CentOS

CentOS is a distribution (or "distro") of Linux that is made to be similar to Red Hat. It was first made because the company that made Red Hat stopped making it free. Now, many people work on CentOS, and many more people use it on their computers. Often, CentOS is used on servers (computers which provide services to people or other computers) because it is stable (does not break often) and can be installed (put on a computer) in not much time, compared to other distributions such as Gentoo. On December 8th 2020, The CentOS Project announced the end of CentOS as it was previously known and announced CentOS Stream. AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux among others now provide 1:1 binary compatible releases with RHEL and the original CentOS. The original CentOS will reach end of life December 2021.


David Gilmour

David Jon Gilmour CBE (born 6 March 1946) is an English musician, record producer, songwriter. He is most famous for being a guitarist, singer and songwriter in the rock band Pink Floyd. Along with being in Pink Floyd, he has worked as a record producer for other musicians. Gilmour has also recorded and released albums as a solo performer.

Gilmour has always been active with many different charities. He was appointed CBE in 2003 for services to both music and for his charity work.

In 1996, Gilmour was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Pink Floyd.

In 2003, Gilmour was listed at number 82 in "Rolling Stone Magazine's list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time" 


Thermal conductivity

Thermal conductivity is the ability of a material to conduct heat. Metals are good at heat conduction. The thermal conductivity of a material is a defining property that aids in the development of effective heating/cooling technologies. A value for thermal conductivity can be determined by measuring the rate at which heat can pass through a material. 

Thermal resistivity is the opposite of thermal conductivity. This means not conducting heat much. Materials with high resistivity are called "thermal insulators" and are used in clothing, thermoses, home insulation, and cars to keep people warm or in refrigerators, freezers, and thermoses to keep things cold. 

Thermal conductivity is often represented by the Greek letter "kappa", formula_1. The units of thermal conductivity are watts per meter-kelvin. Watts are a measure of power, meters are a measure of length, and kelvins are a measure of temperature. From the units, we can see that thermal conductivity is a measure of how much power moves through a distance due to a temperature difference.

Some great thermal insulators are:
Vacuum, Aerogel, Polyurethane

Some great thermal conductors are:
Silver, Copper, Diamond

Silver is one of the most thermally conductive materials (and is relatively common), and because of this there are some cool experiments you can do with silver that show extremely well how thermal conduction works.

One example is when you put 2 spoons in boiling water, one spoon is steel and the other is silver. When you take the spoons out of the boiling water, the silver spoon is hotter than the steel spoon. The reason for this is that silver conducts heat better than steel. The silver spoon will also cool off faster because of this, as it is better at releasing heat.

Another example of silver's thermal conductivity is to put different materials on ice cubes. An iron washer will just sit on the ice and slowly become colder. A copper penny will melt through the ice cube and become colder faster. A silver coin, spoon, or ring on the ice cube will sink into it almost as though the ice cube were made of thick syrup, and the silver will become ice cold almost instantly. Again, this is because the silver is really good at drawing heat from the air and giving it to the ice cube. Copper is also good at this, but not as much as silver.

Hydride

A hydride is a compound with hydrogen bonded to other elements. Except for a few of the Noble gases, all of the elements in the periodic table can form hydrides. The properties of hydrides can be very different, but some of the hydrides have similar properties. 

"Metallic hydrides": compounds with ionic bonding. They are very reactive, making them difficult to dissolve. Most alkali metals and alkaline earth metals form ionic hydrides.

"Metallic" or "Interstitial hydrides": These have metallic properties like good electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity. They are called interstitial because hydrogen can enter the metallic lattice (framework of metal atoms). Metallic hydrides are mostly formed from the metals in the groups 3 to 5 of the periodic table. Some of these are used in the nickel metal-hydride battery.

"Covalent hydrides": These have covalent bonds between hydrogen and the other element. Most of the p-block elements form covalent hydrides. Many of these hydrides are unstable in air or water or when heated. Hydrocarbons are the hydrides of carbon, ammonia is a hydride of nitrogen, and water is a hydride of oxygen.

Horse the Band

Horse the Band is an American hardcore rock band from Lake Forest, California that was started in 1999. They are famous for using video-game style music in their songs.




Hospice

A hospice is a type of medical treatment that helps take care of people who are very sick and have an illness that they will not be able to heal from. People who stay in hospices are expected to die soon, but sometimes they get better. Hospices are different from other medicinal treatments because they mostly try to make people feel better instead of trying to cure them. Hospice tries to allow people to die with as little pain as possible. A member of the hospice team visits regularly, and someone is usually always available by phone — 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Hospice may be covered by Medicare.

Most hospice care is provided at home — with a family member typically serving as the primary caregiver. However, hospice care is also available at hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities and dedicated hospice facilities.

Hospices have doctors, nurses, and other people who go to patients houses, nursing homes and hospitals to talk to people who want to use hospice medicine.

In the United States hospice treatment is a benefit provided by the federal government since 1982. Under the Medicare Hospice Benefit, a person certified by two physicians to have less than six months to live can get specialized hospice services through various insurance programs.

The Hospice movement was started in England in the 1950s by a nurse named Dame Cicely Saunders. The word Dame at the start of her name means that she did such good work starting hospices that the Queen of England made her a female knight.

A different nurse named Florence Wald brought hospice medicine to the United States because she worked with Dame Cicely Saunders and liked what she did. 

There are four types of hospice care, and all of them focus on different stages of a patient’s needs.

In-Home Hospice : The first level of hospice care is in-home hospice, which means that hospice staff will come to a patient’s home to provide care. This type of hospice care is typically used in the early stages of hospice, helping patients transition from a hospital to their homes.
Continuous Care: The second level of hospice care is continuous care, which is in-home care with 24/7 support. With constant care, a patient has a member of hospice staff on hand at all times to help assist in symptom management.

In-Patient Hospice: The third level of hospice care is in-patient hospice care. While it’s never a patient’s first choice to be in a hospital, away from the comfort of their home, there are times when symptoms become too much to manage even by continuous in-home care. In-patient hospice allows a patient to be observed by nurses and physicians around the clock, ready at a moment’s notice to treat advanced symptoms and offer expert insights and care. In-patient hospice facilities tend to be calmer and more “home-like” than regular hospital visits to replicate a familiar setting’s comfort.

Respite Care: The fourth and final level of hospice care is respite care. Respite care exists as a sort of hybrid between in-patient and in-home or continuous home care. The point of respite care is primarily to offer relief to caregivers. Especially for those with no medical background, becoming a primary caregiver to a hospice patient can be too physically taxing and emotionally draining. Respite care allows caregivers relief from the responsibility of having a hospice patient in their care for as many as five days and nights so they can rest.

Offa of Mercia

Offa was the King of Mercia from 757 until his death in July 796. 
Many historians regard Offa as the most powerful Anglo-Saxon king before Alfred the Great. Offa died in 796 and was succeeded by his son, Ecgfrith, who reigned for less than five months before Coenwulf of Mercia became king.

Offa was the son of Thingfrith, a descendant of Eowa of Mercia. Eowa was a king of Mercia who ruled along with his more famous brother Penda of Mercia. In 757 the king of Mercia,Athelbald, was murdered. There was a short civil war between others claiming the throne. An ealdorman named Beornred took the throne of Mercia but Offa drove him out of Mercia and became king himself that same year. The alliances Athelbald had formed fell apart when Offa came to power. Offa had very little power outside of Mercia for the first several years of his reign.

The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle makes no mention of Offa for the years between 757—777. No Mercian chronicles from this time period have survived. Charters are the only records that give any idea of Offa's power outside of Mercia. But he proved to be ruthless, bold and creative in bringing Kent, Sussex and Essex under his control. Aethelbert the king of Kent was apparently under Offa's influence before he died in 762. In 794 another Aethelbert, a king in East Anglia was beheaded at Offa's command. When Egbert of Wessex made a bid for the throne of Wessex in 786 Offa had him banished from England. He made Beorhtric king of Wessex instead. Egbert was welcomed at the court of Charlemagne for at least three years. In charters Offa issued in Kent, East Anglia, Sussex and Middlesex he simply used the style "Rex Merciorum" (Latin for king of Mercia). Only in three church charters does he expand his title to indicate he is overlord of all of England. 
Offa had diplomatic relations with Charlemagne. He was one of the few Anglo-Saxon monarchs to have dealings with continental rulers. Letters and presents were exchanged. But when Offa sought a marriage of his son to one of Charlemagne's daughters, relations were quickly cut off. Charlemagne had all Frankish ports closed to British ships. Offa, very involved in church affairs, presided over church councils personally in 786-7. In 787 he convinced the pope to create the position of archbishop of Lichfield in Mercia. He wanted his own archbishop who was closer at hand than the Archbishop of Canterbury. He reorganized the defenses of his kingdom. One of these defenses, Offa's Dyke was a massive earthworks between Mercia and the Welsh kingdoms to the west. Offa died in 796. His son, Ecgfrith, lasted only 141 days as king. Mercia was never again as powerful as it was during Offa's reign.

Higgs boson

The Higgs boson (or Higgs particle) is a particle in the Standard Model of physics. In the 1960s Peter Higgs was the first person to suggest that this particle might exist. On 14 March 2013, scientists at CERN confirmed for the first time that they had found a Higgs particle.

The Higgs particle is one of the 17 particles in the Standard Model, the model of physics which describes all known basic particles. The Higgs particle is a boson. Bosons are thought to be particles which are responsible for all physical forces. Other known bosons are the photon, the W and Z bosons, and the gluon. Scientists do not yet know how to combine gravity with the Standard Model.

The Higgs field is a fundamental field of crucial importance to particle physics theory. Unlike other known fields such as the electromagnetic field, the Higgs field takes the same non-zero value almost everywhere. The question of the Higgs field's existence was the last unverified part of the Standard Model of particle physics and, according to some, was "the central problem in particle physics".

It is difficult to detect the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson is very massive compared to other particles, so it does not last very long. There are usually no Higgs bosons around because it takes so much energy to make one. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN was built mainly for this reason. It speeds up two bunches of particles to almost light speed (travelling in opposite directions), before setting them on a path to collide with each other.

Each collision produces a flurry of new particles which are detected by detectors around the point where they collide. There is still only a very small chance, one in 10 billion, of a Higgs boson appearing and being detected. To find the few collisions with evidence of the Higgs boson, the LHC smashes together trillions of particles, and supercomputers sift through a massive amount of data.

Higgs bosons obey the conservation of energy law, which states that no energy is created or destroyed, but instead can be transferred or change form. First, the energy starts out in the gauge boson that interacts with the Higgs field. This energy is in the form of kinetic energy as movement. After the gauge boson interacts with the Higgs field, it slows down. This slowing down reduces the amount of kinetic energy in the gauge boson. However, this energy is not destroyed. Instead, the energy from the motion goes into the field and is converted into mass-energy, which is the energy stored in mass. The mass created can become what we call a Higgs boson. The amount of mass created comes from Einstein's famous equation E=mc, which states that mass is equal to a large amount of energy (for example, 1 kg of mass is equivalent to almost 90 quadrillion joules of energy—the same amount of energy used by the entire world in roughly an hour and a quarter in 2008). Since the amount of mass-energy created by the Higgs field is equal to the amount of kinetic energy that the gauge boson lost by slowing down, energy is conserved.

Higgs bosons are used in a variety of science fiction stories. The physicist Leon Lederman called it the "God particle" in 1993.

On 12 December 2011, the two teams at the Large Hadron Collider looking for the Higgs boson, ATLAS and CMS, announced that they had finally seen results which could suggest the Higgs boson existed; however, they did not know for certain if this was true.

On 4 July 2012, the teams at the Large Hadron Collider declared that they had discovered a particle which they think is the Higgs boson.

On 14 March 2013 the teams had done much more testing, and announced that they now think the new particle is a Higgs boson.


Taylor series

A Taylor series is an idea used in computer science, calculus, chemistry, physics and other kinds of higher-level mathematics. It is a series that is used to create an estimate (guess) of what a function looks like. There is also a special kind of Taylor series called a Maclaurin series.

The theory behind the Taylor series is that if a point is chosen on the coordinate plane (x- and y-axes), then it is possible to guess what a function will look like in the area around that point. This is done by taking the derivatives of the function and adding them all together. The idea is that it is possible to add the infinite number of derivatives and come up with a single finite sum.

In mathematics, a Taylor series shows a function as the sum of an . The sum's terms are taken from the function's derivatives. Taylor series come from Taylor's theorem.

The Ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea first came up with the idea of this series. The paradox called "Zeno's paradox" is the result. He believed that it would be impossible to add an infinite number of values and get a single finite value as a result.

Another Greek philosopher, Aristotle, came up with an answer to the philosophical question. It was Archimedes, however, who came up with a mathematical solution using his method of exhaustion. He was able to prove that when something is split up into an infinite number of tiny pieces, they will still add up to a single whole when all of them are added back together. The ancient Chinese mathematician Liu Hui proved the same thing several hundred years later.

The earliest known examples of the Taylor series are the work of Mādhava of Sañgamāgrama in India in the 1300s. Later Indian mathematicians wrote about his work with the trigonometric functions of sine, cosine, tangent, and arctangent. None of Mādhava's writings or records still exists today. Other mathematicians based their work on Mādhava's discoveries and worked more with these series until the 1500s.

James Gregory, a Scottish mathematician, worked in this area in the 1600s. Gregory studied the Taylor series and published several Maclaurin series. In 1715, Brook Taylor discovered a general method for applying the series to all functions. (All of the previous research showed how to apply the method to only specific functions.) published a special case of the Taylor series in the 1700s. This series, which is based around zero, is called the "Maclaurin series".

A Taylor series can be used to describe any function "ƒ"("x") that is a smooth function (or, in mathematical terms, "infinitely differentiable.") The function "ƒ" can be either real or complex. The Taylor series is then used to describe what the function looks like in the neighborhood of some number "a".

This Taylor series, written as a power series, looks like:

This formula can also be written in sigma notation as:

Here "n"! is the factorial of "n". "ƒ"("a") is the "n"th derivative of "ƒ" at the point "a". formula_3 is a number in the function's domain. If the Taylor Series of a function is equal to that function, the function is called an "analytic function."

When formula_4, the function is called a Maclaurin series. The Maclaurin series written as a power series looks like:

When written in sigma notation, the Maclaurin series is:

Some important Taylor series and Maclaurin series are the following.

Where formula_15 is the nth Bernoulli number, and formula_16 is the natural logarithm.

Wilhelm Furtwängler

Wilhelm Furtwängler (born Berlin, 25 January 1886; died Baden-Baden, 30 November 1954) was a German conductor. He is thought of as one of the greatest conductors in history. Many people say that he is the best ever. The famous Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini said he was the world's best conductor other than himself.

Furtwängler was especially famous for conducting the music of famous German composers. His performances of Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, and Wagner are very well known and loved by many people.

Furtwängler was born on January, 25, 1886 in Berlin, Germany. He grew up in Munich, where his father was an archaeologist and professor. He started learning about music when he was very young. He learned to play the piano and was very talented. He also began writing music. He wrote several pieces before he was 20 years old. He kept writing music for the rest of his life, but his pieces never became very famous.

Furtwängler first started conducting as a young man. He wanted to conduct in order to perform his own music. However, he quickly became famous for conducting the music of others. The very first piece he conducted in public was the 9th Symphony of Bruckner. He conducted many orchestras before he finally became the leader of the world-famous Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in 1922. Later, he also had many other important conducting jobs. The most important was the director of the Bayreuth Festival, a very famous German music festival.

When the Nazis took over Germany in the 1930s, Furtwängler was in an awkward position. He wanted to conduct some kinds of music that the Nazis did not like. He left some of his conducting jobs in protest when they did not let him perform. In 1936 he almost left Germany to live in the United States, where the New York Philharmonic Orchestra wanted him to conduct. However, the Nazis still thought he was a good conductor, and they kept him in Germany. He also wanted to stay to protect the German music from the Nazis. People in the United States did not like him for staying, even though he did not really like the Nazis.

During World War II Furtwängler continued to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic. He gave many very famous concerts during this time. But towards the end of the war, the Nazis became unhappy with him. He fled from Germany in 1945 and lived in Switzerland for several years. He did not conduct again for two years.

After the war, Furtwängler was still in a difficult position. The Allies thought that he had been a Nazi supporter because he had stayed in Germany. They put him on trial, but finally decided he was innocent. He was allowed to go back to conducting in 1947. Even though he was innocent, people in the US still did not like him. He was going to conduct the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, but he was not allowed to because people got angry about it.

Furtwängler gave many successful concerts after the war. He still conducted the Berlin Philharmonic and other famous orchestras in Europe. Furtwängler gave the most famous concert of his career in 1951. That year, he conducted Beethoven's 9th Symphony at the Bayreuth Festival. It was the first time that the festival had happened since the end of the war, six years before. Many people say that this concert was the greatest musical concert in history. Furtwängler finally died in 1954, when he was 68 years old.

Furtwängler had a very unusual way of conducting. His movements with the baton were very awkward and jerky. Some people said he looked "like a puppet on a string" when he conducted. He liked to slow down and speed up the music very often. Furtwängler believed that there was more to music than just the notes on the score. He felt it was the performer's job to make each performance something special. This meant that he often played the same piece in very different ways at different concerts. Even when he changed the way he played a piece, though, the music was thought to be very beautiful. He did not like conductors who just played the notes on the page without doing anything special with the music.

As a younger conductor, Furtwängler played music by many different composers. However, as he got older, he usually only played music by the great German composers. Some of his favorites were Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, and Wagner.

Furtwängler did not make many recordings in studios. Recording technology was still very new at the time and did not work well for recording long classical pieces at first. However, many of Furtwängler's concerts were recorded, especially during and after World War II. Today people think these are some of the best recordings of all time. His famous concert at Bayreuth in 1951 is one of these concert recordings.


Face (professional wrestling)

In professional wrestling, a face is a good guy. 

A face should not cheat and most will not use weapons. They often try to make the crowd happy and excited. 

Often, a face will fight a heel (bad guy), so the crowd will cheer the face and boo the heel.

Fagaceae

The family Fagaceae, also called beech family, is a family of flowering plants. It has about 900 species of evergreen and deciduous trees and shrubs. They have alternate simple leaves with pinnate venation, unisexual flowers in the form of catkins, and fruit in the form of nuts. 

All the oaks, beeches and chestnuts are in this family.

Heat sink

A heat sink is an object that cools another part that is too hot. It works with a CPU fan to do this. The heat sink is in contact with the part that should be cooled. It takes heat away and dissipates it, for example into the air around it.

Heat sinks are found in most computers. The chips inside a computer can get very hot. Therefore, they need to be cooled, so that they don't break. This is usually done with a heat sink. Heat sinks are also found in most high fidelity audio amplifiers.

Haka

The haka (; plural "haka", in both Māori and English) is a ritual dance of the Maori, the native people of New Zealand. Sometimes, a haka is performed to excite friends and to scare enemies. In peace time, a haka is performed as a challenge. 

A haka can include:

There are many different haka. Each tells a story. The most famous haka is "Ka Mate". The Ka Mate haka is performed by many New Zealand sports teams before games. Another famous haka is 'Kapo O Pango' which is performed by New Zealand's rugby union team. This team is called the All Blacks. 

Women are not usually allowed to perform haka. Instead, they sing and chant in support.

Crisis on Infinite Earths

Crisis on Infinite Earths was a story told in American comic books in the year 1985. It lasted for 12 issues. Marv Wolfman wrote it and George Pérez drew it. It changed much about the history of the DC Universe, and allowed the editors of DC Comics to simplify their then 55 year old history.

Endosymbiosis

Endosymbiosis occurs when a symbiont lives inside the body or the cells of another organism. It is a very widespread phenomenon in living things.

Examples are:

Endosymbiont theory is the idea that eukaryote cells arose in evolution by the fusion of previously free-living protists (prokaryotes). The theory was first suggested by the Russian botanist Konstantin Mereshkovsky in 1905. The nature of lichens had been worked out; mitochondria and chloroplasts had been seen in cells, and their similarity to bacteria noted. The theory was initially dismissed, but was re-examined when more was known about cell biology, by Lynn Margulis

The eukaryote cell is the type of cell all animals and plants are made of. Some cell organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, contain DNA. In each case, this DNA is thought to be the remnant of the genome of a once independent bacterium. The theory is that the eukaryote cell evolved by the fusion of several bacteria or archaean organisms. Together, the new cells survived, prospered and evolved into new and complex forms of life. The origin of other organelles in the eukaryotic cell is still under review: the cell nucleus, its membrane, chromosomes and centromeres; the Golgi body; the flagella or cilia; the intracellular membranes. Some of these may also have had a symbiotic origin. 

Examples:




There is evidence that symbiosis happened between ancient bacteria to produce the double-membrane class known as gram-negative bacteria. Since the gram-negative bacteria include the cyanobacteria, this was the first of several such events in the history of the eukaryotes.

Four-stroke engine

The four-stroke engine is an internal combustion engine. The four strokes are:

Pecan

The pecan ("Carya illinoinensis") is a species of hickory nut, native to south-central North America, in the United States from southern Iowa, Illinois and Indiana east to western Kentucky, North Carolina and western Tennessee, south through Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas; and in Mexico from Coahuila south to Jalisco and Veracruz.

"Pecan" is from an Algonquian word, meaning a nut requiring a stone to crack.

Pecans are often used in cooking in the Southern United States. A common dessert there is pecan pie.

Tariff

A tariff is a tax charged on goods as they pass between one country and another. A tariff can be placed on goods being brought into the country (imports), and goods being exported from the country to another. It is usually done to make money for the government. It may also be done for protectionism. Protectionism makes it easier for local products to sell by making products from foreign countries more expensive.

Often, one government will have an agreement with another not to place any tariffs on goods that are traded between them. This kind of agreement is called free trade.

The same word, tariff, is often used for the pricing of gas and electricity. 


Klemens Wenzel von Metternich

Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich (German: Klemens Wenzel Nepomuk Lothar, Fürst von Metternich-Winneburg zu Beilstein) (May 15, 1773 – June 11, 1859) was an Austrian politician. He is thought of as one of the most important diplomats of all time. Metternich was Foreign Minister for Austria from 1809 to 1848. He got Austria out of a bad treaty with Napoleon, which forced Austria to fight for France. Metternich then helped to build a system in Europe that kept the peace for most of the next 100 years.

In 1809, when Metternich became foreign minister, Napoleon had control of most of Europe. France had taken over some of the closest countries directly. In more distant countries like Austria and Prussia, Napoleon forced them to sign treaties that would make them fight on his side in wars. Metternich thought that was bad for Austria. When Napoleon declared war and raised a huge army for the French invasion of Russia, Metternich told the Russians that Austria would not attack but only defend. Napoleon lost badly in Russia, and Metternich used that excuse to get out of the treaty.

In 1814, troops of the Quadruple Alliance (Prussia, Russia, Austria and the United Kingdom) had entered France, and Napoleon had lost the war. For the next year, diplomats from all over Europe met at the Congress of Vienna to decide the future after Napoleon.

Metternich believed that the best way to keep Europe peaceful was to create a balance of power, with no country being strong enough to beat all the other countries. To make sure that happened, he made some countries stronger so that other countries, especially France, would think twice about going to war. For example, he added Belgium and Luxembourg to the 
Netherlands, he turned 300 small countries of Germany into a group of larger countries, and he put together some countries in what we call Italy today.

After making that new order, Metternich also did a lot to keep it together. For example, he Alexander I of Russia Alexander wanted to send troops to Greece to protect Orthodox Christians there fighting the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire, which was Muslim. The Ottomans had become weak, and Alexander would probably have won. Metternich was afraid that if the Ottoman Empire fell apart, all of the powerful countries in Europe would start fighting to get its land. That would upset Metternich's balance and start a huge war. Also, Russia might get too big and too powerful. Therefore, Metternich convinced the Alexander attacking now would make the Ottomans would fall apart before Alexander was ready to take it for himself, and the United Kingdom and France would get most of it. Alexander agreed to help keep the Ottoman Empire going so that Russia could later take all of it. Also, he was talked out of sending troops to Greece.

Metternich kept peace in Europe for a long time, but there were still some revolts in Europe. Finally in 1848, many revolts happened at the same time. One of them was in Austria, and the rebels had Metternich taken out of office. After he was gone, Otto von Bismarck in Prussia managed to become powerful, take over the German Confederation and start a big German country, which still exists. Having one big Germany, however, upset Metternich's balance and helped to cause World War I.

German Confederation

The German Confederation replaced the Holy Roman Empire in Central Europe. After the Holy Roman Empire fell, Germany had fallen into over 300 different small kingdoms. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna decided that these weak kingdoms were not strong enough to keep France from trying to take them over, which it had already done once under Napoleon. So the Congress combined all those little countries into 39 larger countries, which were still very small compared to the powerful countries of Europe. 

The problem was that the Congress did not want to make them too strong, or they'd start taking over other countries. So they put the 39 countries into a confederation which meant that they were all separate countries, but they agreed to help defend each other, and in some ways acted like one big country. The Confederation would not be strong enough to attack another country; only strong enough to preserve the European balance of power. 

The German Confederation lasted until 1866, when the members fought each other. The winners formed a new North German Confederation. In 1871 after winning the Franco-Prussian War, Otto von Bismarck, chancellor of Prussia, combined all the countries of Germany into the German Empire.

WrestleMania XXVI

WrestleMania XXIV is the twenty-sixth yearly WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view event put on by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It took place on March 28th, 2010 at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. 

Global Spectrum, University of Phoenix Stadium's operator, had worked in past years with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) to get the event to its venue. On January 18, 2008, Global Spectrum publicly announced that it wants to hold WrestleMania in 2010. The event became more widely known weeks prior when a photo of Wayne Gretzky wearing a shirt showing the event was seen in the Swedish newspaper "Expressen". A press conference happened on February 24, 2009 at the University of Phoenix Stadium to officially tell people about the event for Glendale, Arizona at the University of Phoenix Stadium; this event is the first time WrestleMania would happen in the state of Arizona. Tickets for the event went on sale November 7, 2009 at 10:00am MST. Advertisements telling people about the date tickets would go on sale used the song "Welcome to the World" by Kevin Rudolf.

Along with WrestleMania XXVI, a group of events known as "WrestleMania Week" was held in the week before the event. The third yearly "WrestleManiArt", an art show and auction featuring work by WWE superstars, was held on March 24. WrestleMania's yearly fan convention, "WrestleMania Axxess", was held from March 25 through to March 27. On March 27, WWE hosted its yearly WWE Hall of Fame ceremony at the Dodge Theater, where the 2010 members were made an official member of the hall of fame.



Ice pellets

Ice pellets are known as sleet in North America, and hail in Great Britain. They are a type of frozen precipitation, little balls of ice. Large ice pellets are called hailstones. Sometimes, ice pellets bounce when they hit the ground.

Howitzer

A howitzer is a special type of big gun used by an army. It has a short barrel, and is used to fire a shell over a short distance. The barrel length of a howitzer is 15 to 25 times of the caliber. Howitzers are special because they're made to fire higher than a cannon but lower than a mortar. Howitzers are almost always used to shoot at targets on the ground, but they can be used for targets on water, or in the air. The name "howitzer" comes from an old Czech word, "haufnice", which was a catapult that could fire many stones. The sinking of the USS Maine was most responsible for causing the Spanish-American War. On February 15th, 1898, the USS Maine exploded in Havana Harbor and sank, killing over 260 of those stationed to the boat.


John Updike

John Updike (March 18, 1932 - January 27, 2009) was an American author of works including "Rabbit, Run" and "Couples". He was born in Reading, Pennsylvania. He died of lung cancer in Danvers, Massachusetts in January 2009.


Clog (shoe)

A clog is a kind of shoe. There are different kinds of clogs. They can be shoes, sandals or completely made out of wood.

Dendrite

Dendrites are the branches of neurons that receive signals from other neurons. The signals go into the cell body (or soma).

A cell may have hundreds of dendrites, but may have only one axon. The dendrites carry signals from other neurons into the soma, and the axon carries a single signal from the soma to the next neuron or to a muscle fiber.

A dendrite from one neuron and an axon from another neuron meet at a synapse, which is a very narrow gap between the two cells. When electrical impulses reach the end of an axon, they trigger the release of chemicals called neurotransmitters. These chemicals cross the synapse to the dendrite, where they trigger the flow of ions into or out of the cell.

The movement of the charged ions in the dendrite causes an electrical current, which spreads to the soma briefly before being restored to normal.

If the dendrites get lots of signals from axons, then it sets off a chain reaction. The chain reaction is a strong electrical current called an action potential that flows down the axon to the next synapse.

Fully differentiated neurons do not divide. However, stem cells in the adult brain may regenerate functional neurons throughout the life of an organism. Generally, once born, neurons do not divide. Many will live the whole lifetime of the animal.

The Sons of Eilaboun

The Sons of Eilaboun is a documentary movie by the Palestinian artist and movie maker Hisham Zreiq (Zrake). It was released in 2007. It tells the story of one of the massacres committed by the newly formed Israeli army during Operation Hiram. The massacres were committed in Eilaboun, a village in the northern Galilee between Nazareth and the Sea of Galilee. In the Eilabun massacre, fourteen men were killed, and twelve of them were executed. The village people were expelled to Lebanon and became refugees for a few months. The villagers eventually managed to return secretly.

The movie starts with Melia Zreiq (an old woman from Eilaboun) saying

“I hope God will bring peace to this land, and let the peoples live together - a good life. I hope there will be peace.”

Ilan pappe takes about Plan Dalet, a plan that David Ben-Gurion and the Haganah leaders in Palestine worked out during autumn 1947 to spring 1948, and explains the details of the plan, and how was it performed. In October 30th, 1948, the Israeli army entered Eilaboun at approximately 5 AM. They then forced the people of Eilaboun together in the main square of the village. They chose seventeen young men. Five of them were taken as human shield, and the rest of the twelve were killed, each in a different location. This all happened after the expulsion of the rest of the village to Lebanon, where they became refugees after a five days forced march to Lebanon. After a UN peace keeper observed and reported Israel was forced to allow the people back.

That same night, the Israeli army entered Eilaboun, a then Christian village in the northern Galilee between Nazareth and the sea of Galilee. Most of the villagers were hiding in the two village churches.

The soldiers ordered the people to gather in the village square, while going out of the Catholic Church the soldiers shot at the people killing an old man, making him the first victim. The soldiers chose seventeen men, and ordered the village to walk to Maghar, a village five kilometers to the north of Eilaboun. Shortly after the people left the village, the soldiers executed twelve of the young men, and five were taking to drive an army vehicle as human shields and later sent to a prisoners of war camp. The Israeli army had looted Eilaboun but left the houses.

When the villagers reached Maghar, the soldiers ordered them to continue to Kafr 'Inan, where the near Kafr Inan another man was killed, making the number of victims fourten. Kafr 'Inan and Eilaboun were both expelled to Farradiyya, a nearby village. The Israeli soldiers gathered the people of Eilaboun, Kafr 'Inan and Farradiyya (al-Farradiyya), looted the people and took all worthy. They spent the night in Farradiyya. In the morning the Israeli soldiers separated the women, children and the old from the men. The young men from the three villages were sent to prisoner of war camps. The women, children and the old of the three villages were marched to Mirun where they spent three nights without any food or water. At Mirun, the Israelis put everyone in two cattle trucks, and took them to Rmeish (in Lebanon). Kafr 'Inan and Farradiyya were later razed to the ground by the Israeli army.

About 52 villagers were left in the village, mainly old people and children. The priests complained about the expulsion of the villagers and demanded their return. Following a UN investigation and pressure activated by the Vatican, the villagers eventually managed to return clandestinely. After 6 months from the massacre most of the villagers managed to come back from Lebanon, and all the men were released from the prisoners of war camps.

The movie won the Al-Awda award in 2008, and was screened in many festivals and events as:

Mischief night

Mischief night is a tradition in some parts of the world; a night when people do mischief to their neighbours. This is usually 30 October, the day before Halloween night.
However in some parts of the North of England it is the night before Bonfire Night i.e.the 4th November.

Traditional mischiefs:

Sometimes combined with Trick or Treat.

In Detroit and other parts of Michigan, October 30 is called Devil's Night and includes vandalism and arson.

In southern New Jersey and the Philadelphia region, October 30 is referred to as "Mischief Night," where mischievous teens soap car windows, egg houses, adorn trees with toilet paper, and run away after ringing doorbells. In other parts of New Jersey, October 30 is also known as "Cabbage Night" or "Goosey Night." In Camden, New Jersey. Over 130 arsons were committed in that city on the night of October 30, 1991.

It is known as "Gate Night" in Trail, British Columbia, Winnipeg, Canada and as Mat Night in Quebec, Canada, always on the 30 October, the eve of Halloween. It is also commonly known as "Devil's Night" in many places throughout Canada.

In Yorkshire, it is also known as "mischievous night", "Miggy Night", "Tick-Tack Night", "Corn Night", "Trick Night" and "Micky Night". In Liverpool, it is known as "Mizzy Night"(but unlike in Yorkshire, where it is celebrated on October 30th). It was celebrated on Nov 4 in Merseyside during the 1970s, as well as in Manchester after the war.

Mischief night is becoming popular in Ireland, where teenagers get the week around Halloween off school. This means that many of the nights before 31 October are used by teenagers for vandalism.

Modern mischief includes toilet papering gardens and buildings, flouring and egging of cars, people, and homes, "forking" gardens, setting off fireworks and smashing pumpkins and jack-o'-lanterns. Local shops do not sell eggs to chavs around the time of Halloween. Sometimes the damage includes spray-painting of buildings and homes.

People play "Ding-Dong Ditch": in this 'game', people knock on doors and then run and hide.

A 2006 film Mischief Night is based on a night in Leeds, UK.


Dengue fever

Dengue fever (pronounced "DEN-gi") is a tropical infectious disease caused by the dengue virus. People get the dengue virus from mosquitoes. Dengue fever is also called break-bone fever, because it can cause so much pain that people feel like their bones are breaking.

Most people with dengue fever can get better just by drinking enough water. However, a small number of people get dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. These are medical emergencies and can kill a person if they do not get medical treatment.

There is no vaccine that can keep people from getting the dengue virus. There is also no treatment to cure dengue fever. Doctors can only provide "supportive care," which means they can only treat dengue's symptoms.

Since the 1960s, more people have been getting dengue fever. Since World War II, dengue has become a problem around the world. It is common in more than 110 countries. Every year, between 50 million and 100 million people get dengue fever. Climate change means that there are more mosquitoes. In Brazil it is expected that there will be at least twice as many cases in 2024 than in 2023.

80% of people who get the dengue virus have no symptoms, or have only mild symptoms (like a basic fever). About 5% of infected people get much sicker. A small number of these people have symptoms that could kill them.

After a person gets the dengue virus from a mosquito, it takes between 3 and 14 days for them to get sick. (This is called the virus's incubation period.) 

Often, when children have dengue fever, their symptoms are the same as gastroenteritis (stomach flu), like vomiting and diarrhea, or the common cold. Children are more likely to have bad complications from dengue fever.

Dengue fever happens in three stages: febrile, critical, and recovery.

In the "febrile stage", people with dengue usually have a high fever. ("Febrile" means that a person has a fever.) The fever is often over 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). Sometimes the fever gets better, and then comes back.

During the febrile stage, people may also have:
The febrile stage usually lasts 2 to 7 days. This stage ends when a person's high fever is gone.

In about 5% of people with dengue fever, the disease goes into a "critical stage" next. ("Critical" means "very dangerous.") The critical phase usually lasts 1 to 2 days. Plasma (the liquid part of blood) leaks out of the body's small blood vessels. The plasma can build up in the chest and abdomen. This is a serious problem.

Plasma carries blood cells, glucose (sugar), electrolytes (salts), and many other important things to the whole body. Every part of the body needs these things to survive. If too much plasma leaks out of the blood vessels, there will not be enough left to carry these things to the body's most important organs. Without these things, the organs cannot work normally. This is called dengue shock syndrome. Plasma also carries platelets, which help the blood clot (they help stop bleeding). If a person does not have enough platelets, they can have dangerous bleeding. With dengue fever, this bleeding usually happens in the gastrointestinal tract. When a person has bleeding, leaking plasma, and not enough platelets, they have dengue hemorrhagic fever. ("Hemorrhage" means "dangerous bleeding.")

The recovery stage is when the patient's body is overcoming the disease process. In this stage, the plasma that leaked out of the blood vessels is taken back up into the bloodstream. This stage usually lasts 2 to 3 days. During this stage, people with dengue often feel much better. However, they can have very bad itching and a slow heart rate.

Serious problems can also happen during the recovery stage. If a person's body takes too much fluid back up into the bloodstream, this can cause "fluid overload." This can cause fluid to build up in the lungs, which causes breathing problems. Fluid overload can also cause seizures or an altered mental status (changes in a person's thinking and behavior).

Dengue can affect other systems in the body. It can cause:

Dengue fever is caused by the dengue virus. In the scientific system that classifies viruses, the dengue virus is part of the family "Flaviviridae" and the genus "Flavivirus". Other viruses that belong to the same family and can make humans sick include yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Most of these viruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
Dengue virus is spread mostly by mosquitoes from the "Aedes" genus, especially the "Aedes aegypti" species of mosquito. "Aides aegypti" is the most likely type of mosquito to spread dengue, because it likes to live close to humans and feed off of people instead of animals. A person can get the dengue virus from just one mosquito bite.

Sometimes, mosquitoes can also get dengue from humans. If a female mosquito bites someone with dengue, the mosquito may get the dengue virus from the person's blood. After about 8 to 10 days, the virus spreads to the mosquito's salivary glands, which make saliva (or "spit"). Now the mosquito will make saliva that is infected with the dengue virus. When the mosquito bites a human, its infected saliva goes into the human and can give that person dengue.

A person can also get the dengue virus if they get a blood transfusion or organ donation from someone who has the virus. In some countries where dengue is common, like Singapore, between 1.6 and 6 blood transfusions out of every 10,000 spread dengue.

The dengue virus can also be spread from a mother to her fetus during pregnancy, or when the child is born. This is called vertical transmission.

Dengue is usually not spread in any other ways.

Once a person gets the dengue virus from a mosquito, the virus attaches to and enters the person's white blood cells. (The white blood cells are part of the immune system, which defends the body by fighting off threats, like infections.) As the white blood cells move around the body, the virus makes copies of itself. The white blood cells react by making many special proteins, like interferon, which tell the immune system to work harder because there is a threat in the body. These proteins cause the fever, flu-like symptoms, and severe pains that happen with dengue.

If a person has a bad infection, the virus makes copies of itself much more quickly inside the body. Because there is a lot more of the virus, it can affect many more organs (like the liver and the bone marrow). The virus can stop the bone marrow from making platelets normally. This makes very bad bleeding much more likely to happen.

Babies and young children with dengue are more likely than adults to become very sick. Women are more likely than men to get very sick. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic (long-lasting) diseases, like diabetes and asthma.

There are four different types of the dengue virus. Once a person has had one type of the virus, he usually is protected from that type for the rest of his life. However, he will only be protected against the other three types of the virus for a short time. If he later gets one of those three types of the virus, he will be more likely to have serious problems, like dengue shock syndrome or dengue hemorrhagic fever.

Usually, doctors diagnose dengue by examining the infected person and realizing that their symptoms match dengue. However, when dengue is in its early stages, it can be difficult to tell the difference between this disease and other infections caused by viruses.

The World Health Organization says that a person probably has dengue if:
The World Health Organization also says that in areas where dengue is common, any warning signs, plus a fever, usually signal that a person has dengue fever.

Some blood tests show changes when a person has dengue fever. The earliest change is a low number of white blood cells in the blood. A low number of platelets can also signal dengue. Special blood tests can look for the dengue virus itself; the virus's nucleic acids; or the antibodies that the immune system makes to fight off the virus. However, these special tests are expensive. Also, in many areas where dengue is common, most doctors and clinics do not have laboratories for blood tests or special machines.

It can be difficult to tell the difference between dengue fever and chikungunya. Chikungunya is a similar viral infection that has many of the same symptoms of dengue, and happens in the same parts of the world. Dengue can also have some of the same symptoms as other diseases, like malaria, leptospirosis, typhoid fever, and meningococcal disease. Often, before a person is diagnosed with dengue, their doctor will do tests to make sure they do not actually have one of these diseases instead.

In 1997, the World Health Organization (WHO) created a system for describing the different types of dengue fever. Eventually, the WHO decided that this old way of dividing dengue needed to be simpler. It also decided that not everyone with dengue fever fit into the old categories. In 2009, the WHO changed its system for classifying (dividing) dengue fever. However, the older system often is still used.

The WHO's old system divided dengue into three categories:

In 2009, the WHO created a simpler system which divided dengue fever into two types: 

There are no vaccines that can keep people from getting the dengue virus. The best ways to prevent dengue are to protect people from mosquito bites and to control the mosquito population.

The best way to control the mosquito is to get rid of the places it lives. The best way to do this is to get rid of areas with standing water (water that does not move). Mosquitoes like standing water and often lay its eggs there. To prevent getting bitten by mosquitoes, people can: 

The WHO suggests a program for preventing dengue (called an "Integrated Vector Control" program) that includes five different parts: 

There are no specific treatments for dengue fever. No known anti-viral medications (medicines which kill viruses) will kill the dengue virus. Health workers can give "supportive treatment" - treat dengue's symptoms to try to make patients feel better. Different people need different treatments, depending on their symptoms. Some people can get better just by drinking fluids at home, and checking with their doctor to make sure they are getting better.

Treating dehydration is very important. Sometimes, people are so dehydrated that they need intravenous fluids - fluids given through a needle placed into a vein. Usually, people only need intravenous fluids for a day or two.

Doctors can give medicines like acetaminophen (paracetamol) for fever and pain. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and aspirin should not be used because they make bleeding more likely.

People with bad dengue may need blood transfusions. Having extra blood will help a person if their blood pressure is getting very low (like it does in dengue shock syndrome) or if they do not have enough red blood cells in their blood (because they are bleeding from dengue hemorrhagic fever).

When people reach the recovery stage of dengue, doctors usually stop giving intravenous fluids to prevent fluid overload (having too much fluid in the body). If a person gets fluid overload, doctors can give a type of medication called a diuretic, which will make the patient urinate out the extra fluid.

Most people with dengue recover and don't have any problems afterward. Without treatment, 1% to 5% of infected people die from dengue. With good treatment, less than 1% die. However, 26% of people with severe dengue die.

Dengue is common in more than 110 countries. Every year, it infects 50 to 100 million people around the world. It also causes half a million hospitalizations and about 12,500 to 25,000 deaths . The World Health Organization says that dengue fever is not taken as seriously as it should be. It calls dengue one of 16 "neglected tropical diseases" - diseases which do not get enough attention. In every million people, dengue causes about 1600 years of life to be lost. This is about the same as other tropical and deadly diseases, like tuberculosis. However, the WHO says the neglected tropical diseases, like dengue, do not get the attention and money that is needed to find treatments and cures.

Dengue is becoming much more common around the world. It is the most common viral disease that is spread by arthropods. In 2010, dengue was 30 times more common than it was in 1960. Scientists think dengue may be getting more common because:
Dengue happens most around the equator. 2.5 billion people live in areas where dengue happens. 70% of these people live in Asia and the Pacific. In the United States, 2.9% to 8% of people who come back from traveling in areas where dengue happens, and have a fever, were infected while traveling. In this group of people, dengue is the second most common infection to be diagnosed, after malaria.

Dengue fever is probably a very old disease. An ancient Chinese medical encyclopedia from the Jin Dynasty (which existed from 265 to 420 AD) talked about a person who probably had dengue. The book talked about a "water poison" that had to do with flying insects.

Written records from the 17th century talk about what may have been epidemics of dengue (where the disease spread very quickly in a short time). The most likely early reports of dengue epidemics are from 1779 and 1780. These reports talk about an epidemic that spread across Asia, Africa, and North America. From that time until 1940, there were not many more epidemics.

In 1906, scientists proved that people were getting infections from "Aedes" mosquitoes. In 1907, scientists showed that a virus causes dengue. This was just the second disease that was shown to be caused by a virus. (The first was yellow fever.) John Burton Cleland and Joseph Franklin Siler kept studying the dengue virus, and figured out the basics of how the virus spreads.

Dengue began to spread much more quickly during and after World War II. Different types of dengue also spread to new areas. For the first time, people started to get dengue hemorrhagic fever. The first case of dengue hemorrhagic fever happened in the Philippines in 1953. By the 1970s, dengue hemorrhagic fever had become a major cause of death in children. It also spread to the Pacific and the Americas. Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome were first reported in Central America and South America in 1981.

It is not clear where the word "dengue" came from. Some people think that it comes from the Swahili phrase "Ka-dinga pepo". This phrase talks about the disease being caused by an evil spirit. The Swahili word "dinga" is thought to come from the Spanish word "dengue", which means "careful." That word may have been used to describe a person having bone pain from dengue fever; that pain would make the person walk carefully. However, it is also possible that the Spanish word came from the Swahili word, and not the other way around.

Other people think that the name "dengue" comes from the West Indies. In the West Indies, slaves that had dengue were said to stand and walk like "a dandy." Because of this, the disease was also called "dandy fever."

The name "breakbone fever" was first used by Benjamin Rush, a doctor and United States "Founding Father." In 1789, Rush used the name "breakbone fever" in a report about the 1780 dengue outbreak in Philadelphia. In his official report, Rush mostly used the more formal name "bilious remitting fever".

The term "dengue fever" was not commonly used until after 1828. Before that, different people used different names for the disease. For example, dengue was also called "breakheart fever" and "la dengue." Other names were also used for severe dengue: for example, "infectious thrombocytopenic purpura", "Philippine," "Thai," and "Singapore hemorrhagic fever."

Scientists keep doing research on ways to prevent and treat dengue. People are also working on controlling mosquitoes, creating a vaccine, and creating drugs to fight the virus.

Many simple things have been done to control mosquitoes. Some of these things have worked. For example, guppies ("Poecilia reticulata") or copepods can be put in standing water to eat the mosquito larvae (eggs).

Scientists also keep working on creating antiviral drugs to treat attacks of dengue fever and keep people from getting severe complications. They are also working on figuring out how the virus's proteins are structured. This may help them create medications that work well for dengue.


Shrove Tuesday

Shrove Tuesday is a holiday in which Christians have ash put on their heads in the shape of a cross in the United Kingdom, Canada, The United States and Australia for the day before Ash Wednesday. Ash Wednesday is the first day of the Christian season of prayer and fasting called Lent.

On Shrove Tuesday people traditionally cook and eat pancakes in Britain. The reason for this was to use up foods such as fat, eggs and milk before Lent.

It is also called Pancake Tuesday or Pancake Day in Britain. In some other countries, such as the United States, it is called Mardi Gras.

In some cultures it has close ties with Mischief night.

Wright County

Wright County is a county in three different states of the United States:


Sicilian language

The Sicilian language ("") is a language spoken in Sicily island and central Calabria. It is spoken by the majority of the inhabitants of Sicily and by emigrants.
10 million people speak the language. It has three stocks: the Sicilian, the Calabro-Sicilian and Salentinu.
Compared to Italian, it is a distinctly separate form of verbal communication patterned by many years of foreign influence. Efforts to force Sicilians to speak conventional Italian include schools, television and radio. Italians maintain that Sicilian is simply a subset dialect of Italian, while Sicilians see their spoken word as a true and separate language. 

Portmanteau word

A portmanteau word () is made of other words, or parts of words. It comes from putting two (or more) other words together, like "motel", from "motor" and "hotel".

"Portmanteau" originally meant a type of suitcase with two separate parts for storage.
The first use as a word combination appeared in Lewis Carroll's book "Through the Looking-Glass". There Humpty Dumpty explains that some of the unusual words in "Jabberwocky" are other words packed together into one word, as two parts of a portmanteau suitcase are packed together.

"Portmanteau" itself is an example, combining the French words for carry (porter) and coat (manteau) into a coat carrier. "Wikipedia" is a portmanteau of wiki (Hawaiian for fast) and encyclopedia.


Installation (computer programs)

Installation means to put a program on a computer so that the computer can run it.

Most programs are stored in special ways to make them smaller, or to gather all the different pieces of a program up into one big piece. Before it can be used, though, the program needs to have these changes undone. Some programs also need to know extra information about the computer it is going to run on, so while it is installing, it will figure out what it needs to know and write it down for later.

Cohomology

Cohomology is something in higher math which is sometimes used to solve certain math problems.

Laplace transform

The Laplace transform is a way to turn functions into other functions in order to do certain calculations more easily. This way of turning functions to other functions is very similar to U Substitution. The aim of this change is to be able to turn the hard work of integration into a simple algebraic addition and subtraction, just as logarithms allow one to add and subtract instead of multiplying and dividing. An example of its use is in ruin theory, which is a subject of actuarial science with regards to insurance.

Functions usually take a variable (say "t") as an input, and give some output (say "f"). The Laplace transform converts these functions to take some other input ("s") and give some other output ("F"). Because of certain shared properties of Laplace transforms, this makes it very easy to manipulate the original function into something useful.

In many kinds of engineering, especially electrical engineering and signal processing, the original function is said to be in the "time domain" and the new function given by the Laplace transform is said to be in the "frequency domain".

The Laplace transform of a function formula_1, written as formula_2 or formula_3, is often formulated as:

where:


Lorentz factor

The Lorentz factor is the factor by which time, length, and mass change for an object moving at speeds close to the speed of light (relativistic speeds). It is named after the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz.

The equation is:
where v is the speed of the object and c is the speed of light. The quantity (v/c) is often labeled formula_2 (beta) and so the above equation can be rewritten:

Classical or Galilean relativity is the idea that if you throw a ball at 50 mph while running at 5 mph, the ball travels 55 mph. Of course, the ball still moves away from you at 50 mph, so if one were to ask you, you "saw" the ball traveling 50 mph. Meanwhile, your friend Rory saw that you happened to be running at 5 mph. He would say that the ball was traveling 55 mph. Both of you are right, you just happened to be moving "with" the ball.

The speed of light, c, is 670,616,629 mph. So if you are in a car traveling half the speed of light (0.5c) and you turn on your headlights, the light moves away from you at 1 c... or is it 1.5 c? It ends up that c is c no matter what. The next section explains why it's not c - 0.5c.

When a clock is in motion, it ticks slower by a tiny factor of formula_4. The famous twin paradox says that if there were two twins and twin A stayed on earth while twin B traveled near c for a few years, when twin B got back to earth, he would be many years younger than twin A (because he experienced less time). For example, if twin B left when he was 20 and traveled at .9c for 10 years, then when he got back to earth, twin B would be 30 (20 years + 10 years) and twin A would be almost 43:
Twin B would not notice that time had slowed at all. To him, if he looked out a window, it would seem like the universe was moving past him, and therefore slower (remember, to him, he's at rest). So time is relative.

Things get shorter in the direction of movement when they travel at speeds", which means fast enough that relativity effects can be observed. During twin B's journey, he would notice something strange about the universe. He would notice that it got shorter (contracted in the direction of his motion). And the factor by which things get shorter is formula_4.

Relativistic mass also increases. It makes them harder to push. So by the time you reach 0.9999c, you need a very big force to make you go faster. This makes it impossible for anything to reach the speed of light.

Still, if you travel a bit slower, say 90% of the speed of light, your mass only grows by 2.3 times. So, while it may be impossible to reach the speed of light, it may still be possible to get close to it—that is, if you have enough fuel.

Cyperaceae

The family Cyperaceae, or the sedges, is a taxon of flowering plants. They look like grasses or rushes, but are not. They are monocot plants (as are grasses), but belong to a different family. 

The family is large, with some 5,500 species described in about 109 genera. The largest is the "Carex" genus of "true sedges", with over 2,000 species.

Sedges include many wild marsh and grassland plants, and some cultivated ones such as water chestnut ("Eleocharis dulcis") and papyrus sedge ("Cyperus papyrus"). These species are widely distributed, with many in tropical Asia and tropical South America. Sedges may be found growing in almost all environments. Many are wetlands, or have poor soils. Ecological communities dominated by sedges are known as sedgelands.

Members of the sedge family have stems with triangular cross-sections (there are occasional exceptions). Their leaves are spirally arranged in three ranks (grasses have alternate leaves forming two ranks).

Objective-C

Objective-C is an object-oriented programming language used to make computer programs for macOS and iOS devices.

Objective-C was created in the early 1980s by two programmers named Brad Cox and Tom Love. However, it didn't become popular until it was bought by NeXT in 1988 for their NeXTSTEP operating system. After NeXT was bought by Apple in 1996, it became the main programming language for Mac OS X and later the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. In recent years, Swift has been more popular than Objective-C.

Objective-C is a strict superset of C, meaning that any code that can be written in C can be used in Objective-C programs without changing it. However, it adds some features of its own that can't be used in a traditional C program.

In Objective-C, functions are called using messages, a feature inspired by the SmallTalk programming language. Messages look like "blocks" of code similar to the one shown below:
[object messageToObject];
These blocks can be nested inside of each other as well, for example:
[[object messageToSendToObject] messageToSendToResultOfInnerMessage];

Unlike other programming languages such as C and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], Objective-C "classes" are divided into two separate parts: 

Usually, these are put in two different files, with the interface using the ".h" extension and the implementation using the ".m" extension.

Objective-C has variants that add features to the original Objective C programming language.

Objective-C++ allows for [[C++]] code to be used in Objective-C applications.

Objective-C 2.0 is an improved version of Objective-C. It adds many features, such as garbage collection (automatic memory management), fast enumeration and properties (the automatic generation of variable methods).

ATLAS experiment

ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) is the biggest experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

It is one of the seven particle detector experiments (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, TOTEM, LHCb, and LHCf) built at the LHC. LHC is a new particle accelerator at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland. ATLAS is 46 metres long and 25 metres in diameter, weighing about 7,000 tonnes. The project is led by Fabiola Gianotti. The project has 2,000 scientists and engineers at 165 institutions in 35 countries. The project began operation on 10 September 2008. ATLAS studies highly massive particles which could not be studied using earlier lower-energy accelerators. ATLAS may start new theories of particle physics beyond the Standard Model.

Taser

A Taser is a weapon that is not meant to kill. Tasers use electricity to shock people so they fall on the ground. If a person is shot by a Taser, they feel like they are hurt and cannot move their arms and legs. Tasers are used by police officers to stop people who want to hurt them, and to stop people who are running away.

Tasers shoot two small pieces of metal called prongs. These prongs are connected to long pieces of metal string. When the Taser is shot, the prongs hit the person and electricity moves along the metal string to shock the person.

If a person is very close, the prongs do not have to shoot but they will still shock.

Even though a Taser is a weapon that is not meant to kill, the prongs can still hurt people. There are some times when people die after they are shot with a Taser. This is because some people get hurt differently by electricity.

In many places, people cannot own a Taser. There are special rules to follow to own a Taser. This is because it is considered a weapon. 

In Canada, France, Israel and the United Kingdom only police officers can have a Taser, but in the United States of America and Poland, most people can own a Taser.

Wallpaper

Wallpaper is a kind of paper used to cover walls inside of houses and buildings. Wallpaper is used to decorate the inside of buildings instead of paint. It is sold in rolls and are put onto a wall using wallpaper paste. Wallpapers can come either plain (so that it can be painted), or with pictures or patterns.

"Wallpaper" is also a word for a picture on a computer monitor.

Photo wallpapers are wallpapers with an image applied to them. Consist of parts (the number of parts depends on the size). The image is applied using large-format printers (plotter) or offset printing.

Wallpaper was first used in Europe around the year 1500. In the time of Henry VIII the English aristocrats couldn't get as many tapestries from France, so they used more English wallpaper instead. During The Protectorate, the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell banned wallpaper. However, by 1750 people made great use of wallpaper and made better wallpaper.

Water is the easiest way to get rid of wallpaper. Water makes the wallpaper paste become not sticky, then the wallpaper falls off.
Sometimes the wallpaper paste is too strong for water, then special chemicals need to be used to make the paste not sticky. Most of the time only new wallpaper has to be taken off with chemicals.
Hot water makes it easier to remove wallpaper. There are special machines that people can use to make water into steam and use it to remove wallpaper.

Animal trapping

Animal trapping, or simply trapping, is the use of a device to catch an animal. Animals may be trapped for a variety of purposes, including food, wildlife management, hunting and pest control. Each year, over 5 million wild animals, including coyotes, foxes and bobcats, are caught and killed in wild traps, mainly in the US, Canada and Russia, although trapping does occur in other countries too on a smaller scale. Traps are indiscriminate, catching the first animal to step on them. Countless dogs and cats, deer, birds and other animals—including threatened and endangered animals—are also injured and killed each year by the traps. Trap checking times range from once every 24 hours to once every 14 days. The regulations on trapping are weak and extremely difficult to enforce, which means untold amounts of animal suffering goes undocumented and uninvestigated. 

Many animals die trying to free themselves, next to dehydration, blood loss and hypothermia. Often animals become so desperate, they resort to chewing or wringing off their own trapped limb in order to escape, breaking teeth and bones in the process. Some may die from blood loss or shock but most animals will be trapped for days before the trapper returns to kill them. 

There are many kinds. For a deadfall trap, a trapper digs a deep hole in the ground and hides it so the animal falls in the hole and can not get out. A snare is a noose that tightens around the neck or other part of the animal.

Over 100 countries, including the EU and China, have prohibited the use of the steel-jaw leghold trap. But in the United States, steel-jaw traps are not only legal, they are the go-to tool for trappers who capture and kill millions of wild animals a year for the global fur market. In September 2019, California became the first state in the US to ban trapping for commercial and recreational purpose.

Minnetonka, Minnesota

Minnetonka is a suburb in Hennepin County, Minnesota. It is 9 miles to the west of Minneapolis. It is the eighteenth largest city in Minnesota. The name Minnetonka comes from the Dakota Sioux "mni tanka", and it means "great water". It has a population of 53,781 as of the 2020 census. 

Ecclesiastical polity

Ecclesiastical polity is the way a church runs. It says who the leaders are, like pastors and deacons, and makes rules for them. There are some rules for the local church and other rules for groups of churches. 

Christians decide how the church should run based on what they think the church is (ecclesiology). There are three main ways:


Building material

Building material is any material which is used for a construction purpose. Many naturally occurring substances, such as clay, sand, wood and rocks, even twigs and leaves have been used to construct buildings. Apart from naturally occurring materials, many man-made products are in use, some more and some less synthetic. 

Bricks are man-made, and so is plaster, concrete, stucco and many other materials. However, they are usually still made out of natural materials, bricks being a good example. They are based on clay. Steel is based on natural types of iron.

One example of a man-made imitation is scagliola, which can imitate more expensive natural materials such as marble.

Leone Battista Alberti

Leon Battista Alberti (February 18, 1404 – April 25, 1472) was an Italian author, artist, architect, poet, priest, linguist, philosopher, and cryptographer, and general Renaissance humanist polymath. In Italy, this first name is usually spelled ""Leone"", but Alberti is known as Leon. Alberti's life was described in Giorgio Vasari's "Vite". 
Alberti is often seen as a model of the Renaissance "universal man“.-
He was born in Genoa, because the Albertis had been expelled from their native city, Florence.  When he was a child the family moved to Venice. In 1428 Leon visited Florence at first time.

Bernardo Rossellino

Bernardo di Matteo Gamberelli (1409–1464), better known as Bernardo Rossellino, was an Italian Florentine sculptor and architect, the elder brother of the sculptor Antonio Rossellino. He was part of the second generation of Renaissance artists and had helped further define the new change in art style.

He had worked to rebuild Pienza from a village called Corsignano.

Greek cross

The Greek cross is a type of Christian cross that is used especially by Eastern Orthodoxy and Early Christianity. It is also known as the crux immissa quadrata. It has all arms of equal length. Often the arms curve wider as they go out.


Pumice

Pumice is a term for a lightweight volcanic rock. 

It is a solidified frothy lava, created when highly-heated, pressured molten rock is shot out from a volcano. Its light weight is due to air spaces, which are caused by fast cooling and loss of pressure. The loss of pressure makes bubbles by lowering the boiling point of the lava (like the bubble-creation when a carbonated drink is opened). The cooling then freezes the bubbles in the matrix.

Most famously, pumice stone has been used as a skin-scraper. It is used in pedicure to remove excess skin from the bottom of the foot, and on calluses (tough areas of skin). 

It has also been used to make lightweight blocks for building, and as a powdered ingredient in polishing.

Giuliano da Sangallo (c. 1443 – 1516) was an Italian sculptor, architect and military engineer active during the Italian Renaissance. 

Antonio da Sangallo the Younger

Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, born Antonio Cordiani (April 12, 1484 - August 3, 1546) was an Italian architect active during the Italian Renaissance.

Giulio Romano

Giulio Romano (c. 1499 – November 1, 1546) was an Italian painter and architect. He was a pupil of Raphael. His differences from high Renaissance classicism help define the 16th century style known as Mannerism.


Carlo Maderno

Carlo Maderno (1556 - January 30, 1629) was an Italian-Swiss architect, born in Ticino. He is remembered as one of the fathers of Baroque architecture. His façades of Santa Susanna, St. Peter's Basilica and Sant'Andrea della Valle were important in the evolution of the Italian Baroque. He is often referred to as the brother of sculptor Stefano Maderno, but this is not universally agreed upon.

Giacomo della Porta

Giacomo della Porta (1532 – 1602) was an Italian architect and sculptor, who worked for many important buildings in Rome, including St. Peter's Basilica.


Domenico Fontana

Domenico Fontana (1543 – June 28 1607) was a Swiss-born Italian architect of the late Renaissance.

Travertine

Travertine is a terrestrial sedimentary rock. It is a natural chemical precipitate of carbonate minerals; aragonite or calcite. This happens from solution in ground and surface waters, and/or geothermally heated hot-springs. Similar (but extremely porous) deposits formed from ambient-temperature water are known as tufa. 

The Colosseum built by the Romans, was made of travertine.

Agostino Cornacchini

Agostino Cornacchini (August 27, 1686 – 1754) was an Italian sculptor and painter of the Rococo period, active mainly in Rome.

Alabaster

Alabaster is a name applied to varieties of two distinct minerals. Gypsum is a hydrous sulfate of calcium, and calcite is a carbonate of calcium. Gypsum is the alabaster of the present day; calcite is generally the alabaster of the ancients. Both are easy to work. They are attractive to look at. Both have been used for making a variety of artworks and objects, especially small carvings.

The two kinds are easy to tell apart. One is harder than the other. Calcite is hard (Mohs hardness 3). Gypsum is soft (Mohs hardness 1.5 to 2). It can be easily scratched by a fingernail. Also, calcite effervesces when it is treated with hydrochloric acid. Gypsum does not.

San Pietro in Montorio

San Pietro in Montorio is a church in Rome, which includes in its courtyard "The Tempietto" (a small commemorative martyrium) built by Donato Bramante.

The "Tempietto of San Pietro in Montorio" is a small commemorative martyrium built by Donato Bramante, possibly as early as 1502, in the courtyard of "San Pietro in Montorio". It is considered a masterpiece of High Renaissance architecture.

Helena, mother of Constantine I

Flavia Julia Helena (; AD c. ), or Saint Helena was Constantine the Great's mother and a Roman empress (). Helena was a wife or concubine of Constantius I before he became a Roman emperor. In Christianity, Helena is a saint because Christian historians during Late Antiquity wrote that she found the relics of the True Cross in Jerusalem. Helena's tomb was the Mausoleum of Helena outside Rome.

Saint Longinus

Longinus is the name given in medieval and modern Christian traditions to the Roman soldier who pierced Jesus in his side with a lance while he was on the Cross. The Longinus legend further identifies this soldier as the centurion present at the Crucifixion, who testified, "In truth this man was son of God." Longinus' legend grew over the years to the point that he was said to have converted to Christianity after the Crucifixion, and he is traditionally venerated as a saint in various Christian denominations.

Saint Veronica

Saint Veronica or Berenice, according to the ""Acta Sanctorum"" published by the Bollandists (under February 4), was a pious woman of Jerusalem. She moved with pity as Jesus carried his cross to Golgotha, gave him her veil that he might wipe his forehead. Jesus accepted the offering and after using it handed it back to her, the image of his face miraculously impressed upon it.

Cheesesteak

A cheesesteak is a sandwich made in Philadelphia. It is made of a long hoagie roll, cut in half and filled with thin slices of steak and covered with melted cheese. The cheese is either provolone or cheddar in the form of whiz. Some cheesesteaks also have onions or green peppers. Pat's King of Steaks and Geno's are two famous places in Philadelphia that make cheesesteaks. Pat's is thought to be the place that popularized the cheesesteak.

Laminar flow

Laminar flow is characterized by the smooth flow of a liquid. This tends to happen at low velocities when there are few disturbances, such as in a straight, smooth pipe. In laminar flow through a pipe, it is assumed that the velocity of the fluid is zero at the boundaries of the pipe and is at a maximum in the center; mathematically, the velocity profile is parabolic. Microscopically, the particles or pieces of the liquid flow in a straight line along the direction of the pipe and do not mix with other layers of fluid. The layers slide past one another like playing cards. This is in contrast to turbulent flow, when a fluid swirls around.

Even though there is no mixing, there is still some friction in the flow. This friction will cause a pressure drop and its numerical value is given by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation.

Juglandaceae

The Juglandaceae, also known as the Walnut Family, is a family of trees, or sometimes shrubs, in the order Fagales. The leaves are pinnately compound, or ternate, and usually 20-100 cm long.

There are eight genera in the family, including the commercially important nut-producing trees walnut (Juglans), pecan (Carya illinoinensis), and hickory (Carya).

Farid Suleman

Farid Suleman has been the chairman "(the person who leads the group of people that controls the company)" and CEO of Citadel Broadcasting since 2002. Before working at Citadel, he spent 16 years as CEO of Infinity Radio, owned by Viacom.

In late 2004, Suleman was in the news for cutting Howard Stern's radio show from four Citadel stations because of Stern's frequent discussions about Stern's move to Sirius Satellite Radio.

In 2007, he was put forward to get the Group Executive of the Year award by Radio & Records magazine. Other people who were close to getting the award included John Hogan of Clear Channel, Peter Smyth of Greater Media, David Field of Entercom, Lew Dickey of Cumulus, and Don Benson of Lincoln Financial. 

Orbiting Carbon Observatory

The Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) was a NASA satellite mission that was supposed to provide world-wide observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide from space. (CO). It was lost in a launch failure on February 24, 2009, when the box of the Taurus rocket which was carrying it failed to come off during launch. The added weight of the box it was in prevented the satellite from reaching its intended speed and height. After that it fell back into the atmosphere and crashed into the Indian Ocean near Antarctica.

Similarity (psychology)

Similarity in the area of cognitive psychology refers to things or ideas that people put together in the same groups, or categories, in their minds. Many psychologists try to find out what rules people use when they decide that two things are similar.

One important tool used by psychologists to look into similarity is computer modeling. Scientists will, for example, ask people to rate a number of objects as more or less similar to each other. Then they will write a computer program that tries to simulate the same answers that the humans gave. For instance, a person might say that "cat" and "dog" are similar words, so a good computer model should be able to take the word "dog" and respond with the word "cat" in a list of similar words. Computer models do this by applying some set of rules to a large collection of real world text (called a corpus).

Once a model can respond with the correct (similar) words, then it is likely that the rules the computer program uses are the same rules that people use to decide whether words are similar.

Another way that psychologists look into similarity is by putting people in special situations and watching what they do. In other words, by using an experiment. When it comes to similarity, this might include listing words, using categories as clues for learning new words, sorting objects into groups, or other tasks that have to do with comparing things to one another.

Depending on how quickly people do these tasks, or how many mistakes they make, psychologists can find out what rules they are using to decide if things are similar.


Bix

BIX is a rock group from Lithuania. It was founded in 1987. They are one of the most experienced Baltic bands and traveled on tours to United States.

Cabinet (furniture)

A cabinet is a type of furniture with enclosed shelves and sometimes a door in front. It is usually made of wood. Metal may be used in industrial or public areas. Some cabinets stand alone; others are attached to a wall. Most kitchens have cabinets for storage of cooking materials and utensils.

Capillary action

Capillary action means either of two things:


Capillary action is a result of the surface tension of liquids. 

An example of capillary action is what happens inside a drinking straw left in a cup of water. The force of adhesion which holds the water together and to the straw is a little stronger than gravity, so the water will rise inside the straw a little higher than the rest of the water.

Another example is what happens when putting a sponge in a puddle of water. The little bubbles in the sponge work like many straws gathered together. When the sponge is dipped in water, the water starts to go into the holes, and the bubbles that are inside the sponge pull on the water that they touch.

Capillary action also takes place inside the human body. For example, it removes tears from the eyes.


Liliales

Liliales is an order of flowering plants. This order of necessity includes the family Liliaceae, but both the family and the order have had a widely disputed history, with the circumscription varying greatly from one taxonomist to another. The best known representative of the order is the lily.

Drill

A drill is a tool for making round holes. Cutting a hole with a drill is called "drilling a hole""." A hole cut by a drill is called a "drilled hole".

A "rotary drill (cutter)" is the most common type of cutter. It functions by pressing a rotating cutter into the stock.

The cutter on a drill can have one or more teeth, and the teeth are arranged to cut efficiently when the cutter is rotated about its axis. Almost all drills have a mechanism to rotate the cutter. Some very simple drills have no moving parts. They must be rotated manually by gripping a handle.

Most drills use "drill bits". Drill bits are long, thin cutters with teeth at one end. The bits are held in the drill by a circular clamp called a "chuck". Because a single chuck can accept many different sizes of bits, different sizes and types of bits can be used in the same drill. Changing the bit in a chuck is fast and easy. The smallest drill bits look like needles, while the largest drill bits can be as big as a truck. Most drill bits are between a toothpick and a big marker in size.

The end of the bit that attaches to the chuck is called the "shank." The shank provides a stable surface for the chuck to grip"." The cross section of the shank can be circular, triangular, or hexagonal. When drilling, it is possible for a circular shank to slip in the chuck. Triangular or hexagonal shanks cannot slip in the chuck, which is an advantage.

Opposite the shank, the other end of the bit is called the "point". The cutting teeth are on the point. When the bit is pushed into material and spun, the sharp teeth of the bit cut off many "chips".

A drill will cut a hole that is equal to the width of the cutter or bit. Because there is no extra space between the "body" of the bit and the sides of the hole, if the chips are not removed when drilling a deep hole the drill will jam. For this reason, many drill bits are shaped like spirals. The hollow paths in the spiral form a screw that carries the chips away from the cutting teeth and out of the hole.

The "cordless drill" is a common type of drill. They are small enough to be held and used in one hand. They are powered by electricity from a battery. Electricity flows from the battery to an electric motor inside the drill. The electric motor drives a gearbox. The gearbox drives the chuck, and the chuck is holding the bit. The mechanical advantage of the gearbox makes the chuck rotate at a slower speed than the electric motor, but the mechanical advantage also rotates the chuck with more torque. More torque on chuck means more torque on the bit. More torque on the bit means there is more force pushing the cutting teeth through the material. More force pushing the cutting teeth allows cuts to be made faster and into harder materials. Without a gearbox, a hand-held electric drill would spin very fast, but it would only be able to drill through very soft materials.

The battery is where cordless drills get their name, because they don't need to plug a cord into the wall to get electricity (they are without a cord, or cord-"less"). When the battery runs out of energy, it can be removed and recharged in a plug-in charger. A second fully charged battery can then be placed in the drill, and drilling can continue while the first battery is recharging.

Liliaceae

The Liliaceae, or the lily family, is a family of flowering plants in the order Liliales. 

List of IOC country codes

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) uses three-letter abbreviation country codes to call each group of athletes that participate in the Olympic Games.

Since 1952, the list of IOC country codes has changed as new countries were added. Sometimes the names of countries were changed. Some countries have had as many as four different codes.

Some of the National Olympic Committees no longer exist, such as Czechoslovakia, the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic, the USSR, the United Arab Republic, and the West Indies Federation.

Twelve historical NOCs or teams have codes that are still used in the IOC results database to refer to past medal winners from these teams.

Jürgen Habermas

Jürgen Habermas (born June 18, 1929) is a German philosopher and sociologist, or someone who studies different societies. He uses a type of theory called critical theory, where he studies how people use power. He also uses the theory of American pragmatism, which studies if something is true or not by the effects of actions. He is known for his work on the theory of the public sphere. He studies power in democracy, and politics. He also studies how people develop a society through language and communication, and tries to understand how that society and the government work together.

Habermas was born in Düsseldorf, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.
Habermas lived in Gummersbach, near the city of Cologne until his graduation from gymnasium. Jürgen was raised in a Protestant religious family because his grandfather was in charge of the seminary, or religious school, in Gummersbach, Germany. Jürgen Habermas went to the universities of Göttingen (1949/50), Zürich (1950/51), and Bonn (1951/54). He earned a doctorate (PhD) from Bonn in 1954 with his work "" (The absolute and history: on the contradiction in Schelling's thought). 

From 1956 on, he studied philosophy and sociology under the critical theorists Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main. Because Horkheimer had asked Habermas to make some changes to his dissertation. Habermas did not want to do this, and thought that the Frankfurt School was not correct in its views of modern culture. Habermas left the Frankfurt School (a school of thought rather than one made of bricks and mortar).

He finished his "habilitation", or highest academic degree, in political science at the University of Marburg under the Marxist Wolfgang Abendroth. His "habilitation" work was entitled, "" (published in English in 1989 titled "The structural transformation of the public sphere: an inquiry into a category of bourgeois society"). In 1961, he became a "privatdozent" in Marburg. He began working as a "extraordinary professor" (professor without a chair) of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg. Hans-Georg Gadamer and Karl Löwith got him this job. In 1964 Habermas returned to Frankfurt to take over Horkheimer's job in philosophy and sociology.

He was in charge of the Max Planck Institute in Starnberg (near Munich) in 1971, and worked there until 1983, two years after the publication of his main work, "The Theory of Communicative Action". Habermas then returned to his chair at Frankfurt as head of the Institute for Social Research. After retiring from Frankfurt in 1993, Habermas wrote many books and articles. In 1986, he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the , which is the highest honour awarded in German research. He is a "Permanent Visiting" Professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and "Theodor Heuss Professor" at The New School, New York.
Habermas was awarded The Prince of Asturias Award in Social Sciences for 2003. Habermas was also the 2004 Kyoto Laureate in the Arts and Philosophy section. He traveled to San Diego and on March 5, 2005, as part of the University of San Diego's Kyoto Symposium, gave a speech entitled "The Public Role of Religion in Secular Context", about the separation of Church and State. He received the 2005 Holberg International Memorial Prize (about € 520,000).

Hannah

Hannah (meaning "grace of God") is a woman in the Bible, in the book of 1 Samuel chapters 1 and 2. She was the wife of Elkanah and the Mother of Samuel. After she begged God for a child, she gave birth to Samuel. Samuel became a prophet of God (a voice for God in Israel). When Samuel was a young child, she took him to live in the temple (as she had promised God), to be an apprentice of Eli the priest.

Jacob

Jacob is a figure in the Abrahamic religions. He was a patriarch of the Hebrew people, as told in the Hebrew Bible, the Talmud, the New Testament and the Qur'an. He was the ancestor of the tribes of Israel, which were named after his male children. He had 13 children, 12 sons and a daughter. 

Jacob had an older brother, Esau. His mother was named Rebecca and his father named Isaac. According to the Talmud, immediately after Abraham died, Jacob prepared a lentil stew as a traditional mourner's meal for his father. The Hebrew Bible says that Esau, who was very hungry, begged Jacob to give him some of the stew. (Esau called the dish, "that red, red stuff", which is why he is called Edom, ("`Edom", meaning "Red").) Jacob said, "If you give me your birthright I will give you some stew." Esau agreed. Soon, Issac became almost blind. Rebecca tricked Issac into giving Jacob the blessing. Jacob's brother got angry, so Rebecca sent Jacob away.

Jacob works for his uncle Laban so he can marry his daughter Rachel. But he is tricked into marrying Leah, her older sister as well. He has children with both women, and with their concubines.

He is very upset when his son Joseph is sold into slavery in Egypt by his brothers. Jacob moves to Egypt when there is a famine. He dies and is buried in Canaan.

Bhopal disaster

The Bhopal disaster or Bhopal gas tragedy was an industrial accident. It happened at a Union Carbide subsidiary pesticide plant in the city of Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India. On the night of 2-3 December 1984, the plant released approximately 40 tons of toxic methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas, exposing more than 500,000 people to toxic gases.

The mixture of poisonous gases flooded the city, causing great panic as people woke up with a burning sensation in their lungs. Thousands died immediately from the effects of the gas. Many were trampled in the panic that followed. The first official immediate death toll was 3,598 in 1989. Another estimate is that 8,000 died within two weeks, that an additional 8,000 have since died from gas-related diseases.

The Bhopal disaster is frequently cited as the world's worst industrial disaster. The International Medical Commission on Bhopal was established in 1993 to respond to the long-term health effects of the disaster. The owner of the factory, UCIL, was majority owned by UCC, with Indian Government-controlled banks and the Indian public holding a 49.1 percent stake. In 1989, UCC paid $470 million ($929 million in 2017 dollars) to settle litigation stemming from the disaster. In 1994, UCC sold its stake in UCIL to EverReady Industries India Limited (EIIL), which subsequently merged with McLeod Russel (India) Ltd. Eveready ended clean-up on the site in 1998, when it terminated its 99-year lease and turned over control of the site to the state government of Madhya Pradesh. Dow Chemical Company purchased UCC in 2001, seventeen years after the disaster.

Civil and criminal cases were filed in the District Court of Bhopal, India, involving UCC and Warren Anderson, UCC CEO at the time of the disaster.[7][8] In June 2010, seven former employees, including the former UCIL chairman, were convicted in Bhopal of causing death by negligence and sentenced to two years imprisonment and a fine of about $2,000 each, the maximum punishment allowed by Indian law. An eighth former employee was also convicted but died before the judgment was passed.[2] Anderson died on 29 September 2014. (9).

In the 1970s, the Indian government initiated policies to encourage foreign companies to invest in the local industry. Union Carbide Corporation (UCC) was asked to build a plant for the manufacture of Sevin, a pesticide commonly used throughout Asia. As part of the deal, India's government insisted that a significant percentage of the investment come from local shareholders. The government itself had a 22% stake in the company's subsidiary, Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) [1]. The company built the plant in Bhopal because of its central location and access to transport infrastructure. The specific site within the city was zoned for light industrial and commercial use, not for hazardous industry. The plant was initially approved only for formulation of pesticides from component chemicals, such as MIC imported from the parent company, in relatively small quantities. However, pressure from competition in the chemical industry led UCIL to implement "backward integration" – the manufacture of raw materials and intermediate products for formulation of the final product within one facility. This was inherently a more sophisticated and hazardous process [2].

In 1984, the plant was manufacturing Sevin at one quarter of its production capacity due to decreased demand for pesticides. Widespread crop failures and famine on the subcontinent in the 1980s led to increased indebtedness and decreased capital for farmers to invest in pesticides. Local managers were directed to close the plant and prepare it for sale in July 1984 due to decreased profitability [3]. When no ready buyer was found, UCIL made plans to dismantle key production units of the facility for shipment to another developing country. In the meantime, the facility continued to operate with safety equipment and procedures far below the standards found in its sister plant in Institute, West Virginia. The local government was aware of safety problems but was reticent to place heavy industrial safety and pollution control burdens on the struggling industry because it feared the economic effects of the loss of such a large employer [3].

At 11.00 PM on December 2 1984, while most of the one million residents of Bhopal slept, an operator at the plant noticed a small leak of methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas and increasing pressure inside a storage tank. The vent-gas scrubber, a safety device designer to neutralize toxic discharge from the MIC system, had been turned off three weeks prior [3]. Apparently a faulty valve had allowed one ton of water for cleaning internal pipes to mix with forty tons of MIC [1]. A 30-ton refrigeration unit that normally served as a safety component to cool the MIC storage tank had been drained of its coolant for use in another part of the plant [3]. Pressure and heat from the vigorous exothermic reaction in the tank continued to build. The gas flare safety system was out of action and had been for three months. At around 1.00 AM, December 3, loud rumbling reverberated around the plant as a safety valve gave way sending a plume of MIC gas into the early morning air [4]. Within hours, the streets of Bhopal were littered with human corpses and the carcasses of buffaloes, cows, dogs and birds. An estimated 3,800 people died immediately, mostly in the poor slum colony adjacent to the UCC plant [1,5]. Local hospitals were soon overwhelmed with the injured, a crisis further compounded by a lack of knowledge of exactly what gas was involved and what its effects were [1]. It became one of the worst chemical disasters in history and the name Bhopal became synonymous with industrial catastrophe [5].

Estimates of the number of people killed in the first few days by the plume from the UCC plant run as high as 10,000, with 15,000 to 20,000 premature deaths reportedly occurring in the subsequent two decades [6]. The Indian government reported that more than half a million people were exposed to the gas [7]. Several epidemiological studies conducted soon after the accident showed significant morbidity and increased mortality in the exposed population. Table Table1.1. summarizes early and late effects on health. These data are likely to under-represent the true extent of adverse health effects because many exposed individuals left Bhopal immediately following the disaster never to return and were therefore lost to follow-up [8].

The plant in Bhopal where the disaster happened started to produce 'Carbaryl' in 1977. Carbaryl is mainly used as an insecticide. At first, the production was 2,500 tons per year. There was no problem, as the plant had been designed for an output of 5,000 tons. At the beginning of the 1980s, Carbaryl did not sell very well. For this reason, the owners of the plant started to cut the costs. This included employing fewer people, doing maintenance less frequently, and using parts that were made of lower-grade steel. Closing the plant was being considered as well. When the disaster happened, there was no production at the plant because there was a surplus amount of material on the market.

There is also a theory related to this which says that the owner of the Union Carbide Company (UCC) did this on purpose to just challenge the government to punish him. However, as we all know, he had escaped long ago using the corruption in the Indian government at that time to his advantage.

The disaster happened because water entered Methyl isocyanate. The resulting reaction increased the temperature inside the tank to reach over . The pressure was more than the tank. The tank had two places to restore the gas. As a result, large amounts of toxic gases were released into the environment. The pipes were not well maintained as All the contents of the tank were released within a period of about two hours. The water had entered the tank because of a sequence of events. The tank had been maintained badly. When cleaning work was done, water entered the tank.

There are different theories on how water could enter the tank. At the time, workers were cleaning pipes with water and according to some claims, because of poor maintenance of machines, leaking valves and use of inferior components for making machines made it possible for the water to leak into tank 610. In the month of December 1985, the New York Times reported that according to the plant managers the hypothesis of this route of entry of water was tested in the presence of official investigators and was found to be negative. UCC also maintains that this route was not possible and that it was an act of sabotage by a "disgruntled worker" who introduced water directly into the tank.

However, the company's investigation team found no evidence of the necessary connection.

The 1985 reports give a picture of what led to the disaster and how it developed. The reports differ in details, however.

The problem was then made worse by the plant's location near a densely populated area, non-existent catastrophe plans, and shortcomings in health care and socio-economic reh
Factors leading to this gas leak include:
abilitation. Analysis shows that the parties responsible for the magnitude of the disaster are the two owners, Union Carbide Corporation and the Government of India, and to some extent, the Government of Madhya Pradesh.

Between 3,500 and 25,000 people died as a result of contact with the cloud of toxic gas. Up to 500,000 people were injured. Many of the injuries are permanent. Some of the chemicals led to birth defects. The numbers vary so vastly because there are no exact figures about how many people lived in the neighborhood of the plant. About 100.000 people were living in a radius of 1 km around the plant where the disaster happened. The owner of the factory, UCIL, was majority-owned by UCC, with Indian Government-controlled banks and the Indian public holding a 49.1 percent stake. In 1989, UCC paid $470 million ($929 million in 2017 dollars) to settle litigation stemming from the disaster. In 1994, UCC sold its stake in UCIL to EverReady Industries India Limited (EIIL), which subsequently merged with McLeod Russel (India) Ltd. EverReady ended clean-up on the site in 1998, when it terminated its 99-year lease and turned over control of the site to the state government of Madhya Pradesh. Dow Chemical Company purchased UCC in 2001, seventeen years after the disaster.

Civil and criminal cases were filed in the District Court of Bhopal, India, involving UCC and Warren Anderson, UCC CEO at the time of the disaster.[7][8] In June 2010, seven former employees, including the former UCIL chairman, were convicted in Bhopal of causing death by negligence and sentenced to two years imprisonment and a fine of about $2,000 each, the maximum punishment allowed by Indian law. An eighth former employee was also convicted, but died before the judgement was passed.[2] Anderson died on 29 September 2014.[9]

In 1998, the Supreme Court of India reached a settlement with Union Carbide: They had to pay 470 million US dollars to the Indian state. At that time Union Carbide made a turnover of about 9.5 billion dollars, 20 times that amount. In return, there would be no further prosecution. Only very little money actually reached the victims.

The terrain where the plant stands is still contaminated with mercury and other carcinogenic substances. Dow Chemical who owns Union Carbide refuses to decontaminate the soil. Greenpeace has estimated that decontamination would only cost around US$30 million.

On December 3, 1984, more than 40 tons of methyl isocyanate gas leaked from a pesticide plant in Bhopal, India, immediately killing at least 3,800 people and causing significant morbidity and premature death for many thousands more. The company involved in what became the worst industrial accident in history immediately tried to dissociate itself from legal responsibility. Eventually, it reached a settlement with the Indian Government through the mediation of that country's Supreme Court and accepted moral responsibility. It paid $470 million in compensation, a relatively small amount of based on significant underestimations of the long-term health consequences of exposure and the number of people exposed. The disaster indicated a need for enforceable international standards for environmental safety, preventative strategies to avoid similar accidents, and industrial disaster preparedness.

Since the disaster, India has experienced rapid industrialization. While some positive changes in government policy and behavior of a few industries have taken place, major threats to the environment from rapid and poorly regulated industrial growth remain. Widespread environmental degradation with significant adverse human health consequences continues to occur throughout India.

December 2004 marked the twentieth anniversary of the massive toxic gas leak from Union Carbide Corporation's chemical plant in Bhopal in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India that killed more than 3,800 people. This review examines the health effects of exposure to the disaster, the legal response, the lessons learned, and whether or not these are put into practice in India in terms of industrial development, environmental management, and public health.

Tristan Tzara

Tristan Tzara (; ; born Samuel or Samy Rosenstock, also known as S. Samyro; – 25 December 1963) was an artist from Romania and France who was known for starting the Dadaist movement. He was interested in symbolism and was more on the nihilistic side of Dada than others.

Dadaism

Dadaism is an avant-garde intellectual movement. It started around World War 1. Although not at first an art movement, it did influence art greatly for a time. 

The movement, formed in Zurich, Switzerland, was heavily influenced by the war in Europe. Its artists rejected modern capitalist society. They used nonsense and protest in their works. Dadaist artists expressed their discontent with violence, war, and nationalism, and were close to the radical far-left. The whole point behind Dadaism was to prove that anything could be art if the artist declared it to be. This was to prove that if everything could be art, then nothing could be art. This outraged many artists as Dadaism deemed their labour intensive artworks meaningless. 

The art of the movement spanned visual, literary, and sound media, including collage, sound poetry, cut-up writing, and sculpture.

Its peak was 1916 to 1922, and it influenced surrealism, pop art, and punk rock. It went against the standards of society.
Followers of Dadaism included Antonin Artaud, Max Ernst, and Salvador Dali. A later version, called "Neo-Dada", arose in the 1960s.

Dadaism began in central Europe, in Berlin and Zurich. Dadaism moved to Paris with Tristan Tzara. Tzara would go on to 'lead' the dadaists of Paris such as as Man Ray, Jean Cocteau, and Marcel Duchamp. 

Dadaism is also closely associated with the concepts of the grotesque, the absurd, and the macabre. The idea of ridiculing the absurdity of existence has its expression in the dramatic art of Samuel Beckett and the so called school of Paris, which included Arthur Adamov, Jean Genet, and Eugene O'Neill.

The word "Dada" may be an allusion to an infant's first words, such as "Mama". No-one knows who invented the name, but there is some historical evidence which says that Tzara picked it out at random from a German-French dictionary, since "Dada" means "hobbyhorse" in French. A hobbyhorse is a long stick with a toy horse head attached which a child can hold in front of them to pretend they are riding a horse. Still, the source of the name is not widely agreed upon.

Rutaceae

Rutaceae is a family of flowering plants. It is commonly known as the rue or citrus family. It is usually placed in the order Sapindales. 

Symbolism (art)

Symbolism was a late 19th-century art movement of French, Russian and Belgian origin. The movement rejected realism and naturalism, and included poetry and other arts. Symbolists believed that art should represent absolute truths that could only be described indirectly.

In literature, the style started with the publication "Les Fleurs du mal" ("The Flowers of Evil", 1857) by Charles Baudelaire. The works of Edgar Allan Poe, which Baudelaire admired greatly and translated into French, were a significant influence; It was also the source of many tropes and images. Symbolism in art is related to the gothic component of Romanticism.

Origin of the name: The name "symbolist" was first used (1886) by the critic Jean Moréas; He invented that name to make a distinguish between symbolists and (other) people from styles of literature and art, that are similar.

Those "painters who are truly representative of the ... aesthetic ideals" of symbolism includes Gustave Moreau, Odilon Redon, and Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, according to Britannica.com.

The ""Vision after the Sermon" (1888, picture), is a Paul Gauguin painting that was done "in the Synthetic style that he developed" in Brittany with Émile Bernard; The picture had influence (of significance) on the aesthetic in works by "the group of artists known as the the Nabis".

The group Salon de la Rose + Croix had (shows or) exhibitions that showed symbolist paintings. Some of the most influential paintings at those shows, were done by Arnold Böcklin, Fernand Khnopff, Ferdinand Hodler, Jan Toorop, Gaetano Previati, Jean Delville, Carlos Schwabe, and Charles Filiger. The six shows were held between 1892 and 1896.
There were several groups of Symbolist painters and visual artists, including Gustave Moreau, Gustav Klimt, Odilon Redon, Henri Fantin-Latour, Gaston Bussière, Edvard Munch, Félicien Rops, and Jan Toorop. Symbolism in painting was even more widespread geographically than symbolism in poetry. Its ideas affected Mikhail Vrubel, Nicholas Roerich, Martiros Saryan, Mikhail Nesterov, Léon Bakst, Elena Gorokhova in Russia, as well as Frida Kahlo in Mexico and David Chetlahe Paladin in the United States. Auguste Rodin is sometimes considered a symbolist sculptor.

The symbolist painters used mythological and dream imagery. The symbols used by symbolism are not the familiar emblems of mainstream iconography but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references.

A symbolist painting may "look" realistic, but actually it represents a non-visual idea. 
Sculptures: In 1898, George Minne (from Belgium) made the sculptures "Kneeling Youth" and the "Fountain with Kneeling Youths". They are highpoints among his symbolist sculptures.

More a philosophy than an actual style of art, symbolism in painting influenced the contemporary Art Nouveau style and Les Nabis (a group of Post-Impressionist avant-garde artists in France).


Alliaceae

Alliaceae is a family of herbaceous perennial flowering plants. They are part of order Asparagales. 

Metalogic

Metalogic is the science of reasoning about the arguments that are in logic itself. While logic deals with external truths, metalogic deals with truths that lie while using logic.

Rationality

Rationality is the state that exists when reason is used. It's also related to moderation in some contexts and sensibility in others.

When a person is reasonable or rational they are using all available information to make a decision, and whether their decision can be judged as rational or reasonable depends on the reasons they made it. If they believe that the most important factor in any decision is how they will personally benefit, then self-interested or even selfish behavior would be rational. But if they believe that benefiting a group of people is more important than benefiting just one person, then purely selfish behavior is irrational. Determinations of rationality depend on context, the background information and assumptions.

Universal reason

Universal reason is something that philosophers think is at the bottom of a thinking system that allows it to understand certain natural things that are generally complex.

Plutocracy

Plutocracy is a form of government controlled by wealthy people.


Corruption

Corruption is a system that starts out good but somehow goes wrong. The word comes from a Latin word meaning "Rotting". Corruption could be a government doing what they say is good, but instead oppress people, or an official doing something wrong. A text that is miscopied, or computer file or computer program which malfunctions or becomes infected with a computer virus, may be called "corrupt". It may also mean an abuse of power, usually for a personal benefit. 

Sometimes the term just means bribery.


Oppression

Oppression is when a person or group of people who have power use it in a way that is not fair, unjust or cruel. It can also describe the feeling of people who are oppressed. Oppressive governments can lead to a rebellion.

Racism, sexism and other discrimination and prejudices can cause oppression, especially if laws are made based on them.

Anarchists say that all government, police and laws are oppressive. This is because they stop people from doing whatever they want to.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the idea of human rights in general, is meant to stop oppression.


Meritocracy

A meritocracy is the condition where people who deserve to can go up in rank, as opposed to a system like nepotism. It applies generally to all positions to which people may be appointed. It is often reinforced by laws, such as that women should have equal opportunities to men in employment.

The philosopher Plato thought that a government based on merit was better than democracy. In democracy, there is no guarantee that you will get the best person, the most qualified person, ruling the state. His criticisms were really of Athenian (or direct) democracy, where anyone could be selected to rule.

In a meritocracy, the people are chosen who are thought to be the best. Some have accused it of being elitist, saying that government by the best will mean that only those who have had the right opportunities will have a chance to govern, creating in effect a ruling class.

It is worth pointing out that Plato did not see it this way. He believed that philosophers were the best people to rule because they were "disinterested", meaning they only had the interests of the state in mind, not their own interest. Plato's point was this: if you want to rule, then it will go wrong, because power will corrupt you. If you are a philosopher, you don't care about power all you care about is truth, so you will rule well, without being interested in your power or status.


Nepotism

Nepotism is when a person in authority gives jobs to their relatives. It comes from the practice of mediaeval Popes, appointing their nephews to important positions. "Nepote" is Italian for 'nephew'.

For instance, Pope Callixtus III, head of the Borgia family, made two of his nephews cardinals; one of them, Rodrigo, later used his position as a cardinal as a stepping stone to the papacy, becoming Pope Alexander VI. Alexander then elevated Alessandro Farnese, his mistress's brother, to cardinal; Farnese would later go on to become Pope Paul III. Paul III was a notorious nepotist. When elected Pope in 1534 he appointed two nephews, aged 14 and 16, as cardinals. 

The practice was finally ended when Pope Innocent XII issued the bull "Romanum decet Pontificem", in 1692. The papal bull prohibited popes in all times from bestowing estates, offices, or revenues on any relative, with the exception that one qualified relative (at most) could be made a cardinal.

In the modern world, nepotism is thought to be wrong, and conflicts with the principle of merit, where the best person gets the job (meritocracy). The argument against the widespread nepotism in countries like Italy is that it damages the economy of the country, though that is difficult to prove.

Mindset

A mindset is a state that usually a majority of people would have in a particular time or occasion. It is formed from things that people are convinced about. It is like a collected norm.

Mindset can also be about how people see their abilities. In this sense, people have two types of mindsets: fixed and growth mindsets. Psychologist Carol Dweck explains that students with fixed mindset believe their basic abilities, their intelligence, their talents, are just fixed characteristics . They have a certain amount and they improve, and then their goal becomes to look smart all the time and never look dumb. In a growth mindset students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and working hard. They don't necessarily think everyone's the same or anyone can be Einstein, but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it.

Existential crisis

An existential crisis is the feeling that is experienced when thinking about life itself being without any meaning at all. It also happens when the thinking involves a person's own death while all alone with anxiety, fear and possibly miserable.


Larry Wall

Larry Wall (born September 27, 1954) is an American programmer, best known for creating the programming language Perl. He worked at NASA for a short time. He is currently working on a new version of Perl.

Philosophy of mind

Philosophy of mind is one part of philosophy that works with the mind. It is about thinking how the mind works, and how it relates to the world. It also deals with consciousness, which is also researched in psychology and physics.

The mind-body problem is the main problem that is talked about in philosophy of mind. It is the problem of how our minds and our bodies are related, and what exactly the mind is. Many different answers have been come up with to solve the mind-body problem. Most of them fall into the two groups of dualism and monism. 

Dualism is the belief that minds and bodies are separate things. One of the main dualist views comes from René Descartes and is named Cartesian dualism, or substance dualism. Descartes thought that minds and bodies were two completely different substances (like matter) in the world. He argued that consciousness was different from the brain.

One reason to believe dualism is that when you ask most people what the mind is, they would say it is their personality or their soul. They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding the idea that there is just one "ontological" thing at play to be too machine-like. Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not. So, for example, one can ask what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person. But it is odd, to ask what an increase in chemicals in your brain feels like. These subjective aspects of mental events are called "qualia" by philosophers. 

But if it is true that the mind can exist without the brain, dualists must explain how a non-physical mind can affect physical reality. This remains a problem for dualism.

Monism is the opposite of dualism because it is the belief that minds and bodies are not separate things. Many monist views are called materialism because they think that minds are not anything different from matter just like bodies. In the early 20th century, a popular answer was behaviorism. Behaviorism says that a person's inner mental life is unpredictable. Only behaviors we can see are useful for scientists and philosophers. This view became unpopular in the second half of the century, during the "cognitive revolution", which saw psychology, linguistics, computer science, anthropology, neuroscience, and philosophy combine together to find ways to study the mind scientifically.

After behaviorism failed, materialist philosophers invented "type physicalism". These philosophers thought that, if mental states are something material, but not behavioral, then mental states are probably identical to a brain states. In very simplified terms: For example, the mental state "desire for a cup of coffee" is actually just the "firing of certain neurons in certain brain regions". However, other philosophers saw that type physicalism could not explain an idea called "multiple realizability". Multiple realizability means that a mental state can be created by different brain states. For example, a dog has a different brain and nervous system for a person. However, both can experience the mental state of "pain". This view led to a different kind of monism called "functionalism", and compared the mind to a computer. Many functionalists think the mind is like software, and the brain is hardware. 

One problem with functionalism is the "Chinese room thought experiment" by John Searle. Searle tells a story of a man that only speaks English locked inside a room. Inside the room are Chinese symbols and a rule book in English on moving the symbols around. Other people outside communicate with him in Chinese writing. The man can reply in perfect Chinese by following the rules, but does that mean the man knows any Chinese? Searle does not think so, and this means that thinking must happen at a higher level than following rules like a computer.

Panpsychism is the belief that mental aspects are basic and everywhere in the world. This could mean conscious experience, or thought, is everywhere. It has a long history in both Western and Eastern philosophy. It is becoming popular again in recent times. Panpsychism is a "middle way" between dualism and monism. A panpsychist might say that humans have a very rich experience, horses less, mice even less, and plants even less. They would say that experiences reduce down to the most basic levels of reality, perhaps electrons are quarks. In this way, there could be a small amount of consciousness in the universe that can combine into the kind of experience humans have. Philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russell endorsed this view of "Russellian" or "neutral monism." Like dualism and monism, there are many other types of panpsychism, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. 

One problem with all types of panpsychism is the "combination problem": how does this small amount of consciousness combine to form a "big" conscious subject? Most philosophers at the moment do not think there is a good answer to the combination problem. Panpsychism has only recently been taken seriously in philosophy and neuroscience, so an explanation of the combination problem may be decades or hundreds of years away.

Mysterianism is an idea that there are no answers to the mind-body problem. There are many different types of mysterianism. The strongest types say that there will never be an answer because our mind has limits. A weaker type of mysterianism might say that we will not be able to answer the mind-body problem until we have more scientific knowledge, or even a "paradigm shift". A paradigm shift means that the basic ideas in our science and the way we explain the world all must change.


Jamaican English

Jamaican English may mean: Jamaican Patois

Jamaican English is a variety of English spoken in Jamaica. It uses parts of both American and British English.

A simple example of this would be "Ku pon dis mama, dis yah mon yah'ead nuh good, truss mi."
Which would mean "Look at this mom, this man is crazy, trust me."

Human-powered aircraft

A human powered aircraft is an aircraft that is powered entirely or partly by the pilot(s). Several human powered aircraft have been constructed in the past 30 years for recreation or to win prizes.

Designing a successful human-powered aircraft is difficult because a very large power to weight ratio must be achieved. This has been the reason why many of these aircraft use advanced composite materials in their construction.

There are human-powered aircraft being designed and made now. One aircraft is being built by Virginia Tech University named the Iron Butterfly. Another one is being built by the Pennsylvania State University named the Zephyrus.


Pennsylvania State University

Pennsylvania State University is a university in the state of Pennsylvania. The main campus is in the city of State College, Pennsylvania and it has branch campuses around the state. It was founded in 1855. In 1863, the Pennsylvania state legislature picked the school to be the state's only land grant college. Its purpose is to do teaching, research, and public service. It teaches undergraduate, graduate, professional and continuing education students both in classrooms and online.

Penn State University Park is ranked among the top-fifteen public universities in the United States. Annual enrolment at the main campus is more than 44,000 graduate and undergraduate students, making it one of the largest universities in the United States. It has the world's largest dues-paying alumni association.

The university's total enrolment in 2009–10 was about 94,300 across its 24 campuses and online through its World Campus. The university offers more than 160 majors among all its campuses Penn State has a US$1.52 billion (as of April 30, 2010) endowment. The university's research budget was more than $765 million for the 2009-2009 fiscal year. In fiscal year 2008, the National Science Foundation ranked Penn State 11th among U.S. universities in research income.

It is a school known for its football team. It is a member of the Big Ten Conference.
It is a "state-related" university, part of Pennsylvania's Commonwealth System of Higher Education. It receives money from the Commonwealth. The state appoints 10 out of 32 people on its board of trustees. It is independent and not subject to the state's direct control. For the 2006–2007 fiscal year, the university received 9.7% of its budget from the state. As Pennsylvania's land grant college, the state and federal governments provide matching funds for research and cooperative extension in agriculture, home economics and related fields.
The board of trustees selects a president of the University. The president controls the university, including day-to-day management. In practice, the president gives power to other departments of the administration, to the faculty, and to the student body. Provost Rodney Erickson became interim President on November 9, 2011, after President Graham Spanier was fired.

The executive vice president and provost is the chief academic officer of the University. 

The football team was led by coach Joe Paterno for 45 years. He was fired in 2011 along with the University President because they failed to report child abuse by a former assistant football coach. Former coach Jerry Sandusky was arrested on child abuse charges for the period 1994 to 2009. Both the Athletic Director and the vice president for business and finance were charged with perjury and resigned. The next day about 2,000 students rioted in protest, supporting coach Paterno. On November 11, the school staged a vigil to show support for the victims of child abuse.

The Education Secretary Arne Duncan said that colleges and universities have "a legal and moral responsibility to protect children", and that Penn State's failure to report the alleged abuse was a "tragedy". The NCAA considered sanctions against Penn State. Moody's Investors Service reviewed Penn State's bond ratings for a possible downgrade. On November 14, 2011, the Big Ten Conference announced that its Championship football trophy will no longer be named for Paterno. On November 13, 2011, President Barack Obama said, "It's a good time for us to do some soul searching – every institution, not just Penn State – about what our priorities are, and making sure that we understand that our first priority is protecting our kids."

Sandusky denied all charges against him, although he was convicted of all charges in October 2012 and sentenced to 30–60 years in prison.

Penn State's sports teams are nicknamed Nittany Lions, except for the women's basketball team, which is known as the Lady Lions. Almost all teams play in the Big Ten Conference. The women's ice hockey team plays in College Hockey America and the men's volleyball team in the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association.

PSU Zephyrus

The PSU Zephyrus is a human powered aircraft being built by students at the Pennsylvania State University. This aircraft will be powered entirely by the one pilot on board. Mark D. Maughmer currently gives advice to the team. 

Social interaction

A social interaction or social relation is the way people talk and act with each other. It may include interactions in a team, family or bureaucracy. It includes any relationship between two or more individuals.
It is a source of socialization and it characterizes all types of social relationships.

According to Gish and N.P, " Social interaction is the reciprocal influence human beings exert on each other through inter stimulation and response."

Interstitial fluid

Interstitial fluid is a type of fluid in the body. It is found in the interstitial spaces or tissue spaces - the fluid-filled areas that surround cells. It makes up about 3/4 of all extracellular fluid. Its main purpose is provide cells with nutrients and assist the cells in waste removal.

Some components of interstitial fluid are plasmatic, lymphatic, intraocular, synovial, pericardial, intrapleural, peritoneal, and digestive fluids.

Extracellular fluid

Extracellular fluid is body fluid that exists outside cells. It makes up about one-third (1/3) of all body water.

Fairness

Fairness is the concept in sociology, law and generally in society, that something should be equal and not be a contradiction to accepted standards. It's related to justice in both the legal and sociological sense. Fairness is also treating others equally or in a way that is considered right or reasonable. Fairness can mean sameness where everything is kept equal by being the same. Fairness can also mean "deservedness" meaning a person gets what they deserve. People who are successful by working hard get what they deserve. People who are lazy and do not work hard get less. Fairness can also be based on need. Those who have more should give more to help others. This is based on the concept that people have obligations to each other. Judges, lawmakers, referees and teachers are among those expected to be fair in their decisions. Fairness is keeping decisions free from any form of discrimination.

In the United States fairness has long been a battle between equality and equity. Equality is the idea everyone should have an equal opportunity. If all the horses in a race start from the same point, the horse that wins is the fastest. Equity is the idea that adjustments need to be made to make things fair for both entities. One should get more than the other because that would be fair in this sense. For example, in the game of golf, when playing a skilled golfer, a less skilled golfer may be given a "handicap" (extra points) at the start of the game. This is to help make the final score fair for both players.

Cross-cultural psychology

Cross-cultural psychology is the study of the difference cultures can have on psychology. The environment, societal customs and changes in the overall structure of different countries may affect the psychology of individuals distinctly. It has relations in anthropology and sociological psychology.

Evolutionary psychology

Evolutionary psychology is a branch of psychology which investigates behaviour which has evolved. It is similar in this respect to ethology, which has always used ideas from evolutionary biology.
This field seeks to identify which human psychological traits are evolved adaptations, that is, functional products of natural selection or sexual selection. Evolutionary psychology usually focuses on behaviour most people share. Some of the more common areas evolutionary psychology is focused on are sex, and social behaviour. Events like violent behaviour need explanation in evolutionary terms.

Evolutionary psychology is related to other fields of science like sociobiology, social psychology, and sociocultural anthropology. Evolutionary psychologists argue that much of human behaviour is the result of adaptations which evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments.

The adaptationist approach is steadily increasing as an influence in the general field of psychology. Evolutionary psychologists hold that behaviours or traits which occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations. This includes our ability to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, and cooperate with others. They report successful tests of theoretical predictions related to such topics as infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, promiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price and parental investment.




University of Waterloo

The "University of Waterloo" is in the Southwest of Ontario. This university is marked the 5th best university in Canada. This university is very large. It was founded in 1957. 

The University of Waterloo holds many contests in mathematics for students in high school. Some contests let you choose the correct answer out of many wrong answers ( multiple choice ), and for other contests one must write the whole answer and how it was found. Anybody in Canada can take these contests. Each contest is named after famous mathematicians, such as Galois or Fermat.




Tarja Turunen

Tarja Turunen (b. August 17, 1977 near Kitee) is a Finnish singer and songwriter. She is a mezzo and lyric soprano and has a vocal range of three octaves. People know her for her work with symphonic metal band Nightwish. She was the first singer of the band. She was dismissed from the band in the end of 2007, due to musical differences. and started making her own music. Because of her soprano voice, she even sings heavy metal songs in a classical way. She was one of the first singers to do this, which made other people want to make similar music.

In 2006 she made a wonderful Christmas album, called "Henkäys Ikuisuudesta". In November 2007, she came out with her first metal album, "My Winter Storm", which had a lot of different music types on it like rock and heavy metal. In 2010 she made "What Lies Beneath", her second metal album without Nightwish. She played some concerts in Europe, and was in well known heavy metal festivals. She made a whole tour for these two albums. In August 2013, she made her third metal album, "Colours in the Dark", which is a very optimistic album and in August 2016, she made her fourth metal album, "The Shadow Self", which is also very optimistic. In December 2017, she made her second magical Christmas album, called "From Spirits and Ghosts (Score for a Dark Christmas)".

Gerontocracy

Gerontocracy is a system of government in which old people make the policies and control the country. It may be ageist as much as it may be conservative.

Ageism

Ageism is when a person is treated badly only because of their age and a highly damaging social construct. Ageism can be bias and discrimination by one person or by a part of society as a group. Discrimination is when a person is left out or abused by somebody who does not like something about them. For example, their facial features, their height or their skin.

There have been many issues at the British broadcasting company, BBC, dealing with people saying that they have issues with ageism. Ageism is often common in the entertainment industry and journalism where what a person looks like is felt by many to be important, although ageism can be directed at people working in their industry even in their private life.

There are two targets for age discrimination: old people (also called senior citizens) and young people. Discrimination against old and young people can happen at places like job interviews. For example, a company might hire a worker who is about 30 years old instead of someone who is about 50 years old, or someone who is around 20 years old, regardless of skill level. Another common example of ageism is not allowing "minors", or young people, to vote, drive, work, marry, or give sexual consent.

Age discrimination is the result of actions taken to deny or limit opportunities to people based on age. These are usually actions taken as a result of one's ageist beliefs and attitudes. Age discrimination occurs on both a personal and institutional level. On a personal level, an older person may be told that they are too old to engage in certain physical activities, like an informal game of basketball between friends and family. They may also be told (most common in today's Western society) that they are too old to date or to be sexually attractive to much younger people and to have a much younger partners, or encounter prejudices against age-differences in general, whether the relationship is sentimental/sexual or even platonic (this particular form of ageist bigotry and discrimination is even more relevant today or in recent times on social media).

A relevant example of the latter case is the infamous "Half your age plus seven rule". Although this relatively recent theory supposedly originated in the West is recognized as bigoted, outdated and ageist and without actual valid basis, one "rule of thumb" to determine whether an age difference is "socially acceptable" holds that a person should never date someone whose age is less than half their own plus seven years.

Physiocracy

Physiocracy is (or was) a government basing its economical policies on natural order. The economists thought that wealth came mostly from agriculture. It is also an economic theory developed by the physiocrats.

Stratocracy

Stratocracy is a system of government in which the military control the country.

Technocracy

Technocracy is a government by scientific method and controlled by technical people. These people include engineers, (who make, build, and maintain engines, machines, public works, and other technologies). "Technocrats" want to improve social and political problems based on technical and "scientific" (technological) solutions. They promise to help solve these problems concerning industries (big business), trade, and how to create and distribute wealth using scientific management. A method of study that uses time and motion to work out the most efficient ways to do something, mainly repeated, routine motions. The man that made the theory of Scientific Management was named Frederick W. Taylor. 

However, Scientific Management was still trying to fix social and political problems with technical solutions. Many of the technological solutions may have solved one problem, while creating many more. Technocrats believed that management could replace politics. Administration is based on the application of rules that make certain outcomes, there are too many different points of view for the management approach to work. 


Timocracy

Timocracy is the rule of only people who have property. It can also mean that the rulers are motivated by honour (where 'timo' comes from, in Greek).


Potassium nitrate

Potassium nitrate is a chemical compound. It has the chemical formula KNO. It contains potassium and nitrate ions. It is often called saltpeter. 

Potassium nitrate is a colorless solid. It dissolves in water. It is a common source of the nitrate ion. Potassium nitrate is a strong oxidizer. It decomposes to potassium nitrite and oxygen when heated. Its pH is almost neutral. It burns with a lilac flame.

It can be made by reacting ammonium nitrate with potassium hydroxide. It can also be made by reacting potassium chloride with ammonium nitrate. It might be made by reacting potassium hydroxide or potassium carbonate with nitric acid. 

Saltpeter is a mineral form of potassium nitrate. It is only found in very dry areas. It is one of the few minerals that have nitrogen in them. 

Potassium nitrate is used in explosives. Oxygen from the air is the most common chemical that is used for oxidation, which is how most fires and explosions happen. Some explosions will use up oxygen so quickly, though, that there is not enough to finish the reaction, and the explosion is not very strong. Potassium nitrate replaces the need for oxygen and takes up much less space, which lets the explosion be stronger and faster. It is a main ingredient of gunpowder.

Potassium nitrate is also used in rocket fuel for the same reason as in explosives, except that the goal is to let the fuel burn longer, not faster. Potassium nitrate is used as a fertilizer, to help plants grow faster and grow in more places where it might be hard for them to grow otherwise. It can also be used to decay tree stumps.

Potassium nitrate is a poison and will cause permanent injury when improperly handled. It also can start fires and explosions easily.


Endoxa

Endoxa was a concept Aristotle talked about. It refers to the opinion not of individuals (which he contrasts by naming that 'doxa') but the consensus of the population and wise people with a supposed more valid opinion than that of the individual.


Pluralism

Pluralism is a concept used in many fields and mostly means that things are done in many parts or ways (as opposed to just a single way/thing in a system or dualism).

In political science it supports more than either one political party or two major dominant parties and thinks that even very minor parties are important.

In philosophy it contrasts monism and favours multiple ideas that could possibly form a structure than a reduced number of entities.


Corpus

Corpus (plural corpora) is Latin for "body". It can mean:



Delegation

Delegation is when an authority or someone generally needed to do something (like in diplomacy) asks someone else to go instead who could do the same job (it could be a deputy or a 'proxy', in politics mostly).

Video game journalism

Video game journalism is a branch of journalism that covers the reporting and discussion of video games. Usually, it covers the revealing of new games, preview of new games, and the reviewing of new games. There has been a large growth in new online gaming websites and blogs.

The first video gaming magazine that is still in publication is the industry-oriented (made for people who make video games) Play Meter magazine. The first consumer (made for players of video games, not the people who make them) magazine specializing in video gaming was the U.K. magazine Computer and Video Gaming. It began in November, 1981. Two weeks later the first U.S. magazine, Electronic Games Magazine, was started. The oldest consumer gaming magazine still sold today is Computer Gaming World.

The first regularly published web based magazine was either Game Zero Magazine which went online in November 1994 or Intelligent Gamer Online (individual issues were downloadable in 1993 but the site was not online until April 1995). Online gaming magazines and websites have many advantages over print-based magazines. New information on future releases can be placed on online publications immediately, but the publishers have to wait until the next issue to put new information in print based magazines.

There have been many criticisms of the ethical standards of the video game journalism industry.



GameDaily's Chris Buffa wrote a series of articles in July and August 2006.

These articles criticized the state of video game journalism and offered suggestions for improvement: 

New Games Journalism is a term that was first used in 2004 by journalist Kieron Gillen. In New Games Journalism, personal experiences with a game, other personal experiences, and references to other types of media are used to explore the design, play, and culture of a game. This type of journalism focuses more on the subjective experience of an individual playing a game rather that an objectively reviewing the gameplay of a game. New games journalism has been criticized for wasting the reader's time with useless information, and for giving the reader a bad review of the mechanics, play control, and A.I. of a game.





Kleptocracy

Kleptocracy ('klepto' meaning 'theft' in Ancient Greek) is the ruling of possibly any kind of government that uses its power to steal from its people. This rarely-applied word was used by Charles Krauthammer, the nationally syndicated Washington Post columnist and political commentator on Fox-TV, on Saturday, March 2, and Sunday, March 3, 2014. He referred to Russia as a "kleptocracy" in a TV panel discussion about its influence in the revolution in the neighboring Ukraine in late February. His political column added another derivation of this word: "kleptocratic".

"Kleptocratic" is used by Krauthammer in the following quote: "But surely the West has more financial clout than Russia's kleptocratic extraction economy that exports little but oil, gas and wisky."


Fairfield, Wisconsin

Fairfield is a town of Sauk County in the state of Wisconsin, United States. About 1,000 people lived in Fairfield as of 2000. Fairfield is the place where the "sand farm" was bought by Aldo Leopold in 1935. Fairfield has an area of 35.6 square miles.

Dahlia

Dahlia is a genus of plants with large brightly-colored flowers. They are from Mexico, Central America, and Colombia. There are at least 36 species of Dahlia. Dahlia are often grown in flower gardens. This flower grows well away from strong, direct sunlight.

Riemann hypothesis

The Riemann hypothesis is a mathimatical question (conjecture). Finding a proof of the hypothesis is one of the hardest and most important unsolved problems of pure mathematics. Pure mathematics is a type of mathematics that is about thinking about mathematics. This is different from trying to put mathematics into the real world. The answer to the Riemann hypothesis is "yes" or "no".

The conjecture is named after a man called Bernhard Riemann. He lived in the 1800s. He was a well-known dancer, but left this career after heavy backlash from his parents to pursue mathematics.The Riemann hypothesis asks a question about a special thing called the Riemann zeta function.

If the answer to the question is "yes", this would mean mathematicians can know more about prime numbers. Specifically, it would help them know how to find prime numbers. The Riemann hypothesis is so important, and so difficult to prove, that the Clay Mathematics Institute has offered $1,000,000 to the first person to prove it.

The Riemann zeta function is a kind of function. Functions are things in mathematics like equations. Functions take in numbers and give you other numbers back. This is like how you get an answer back when you ask a question. The number you put in is called an "input". The number you get back is called a "value". Every input you put into the Riemann zeta function gives you a special value back. You mostly get a different value for each input. But each input gives you the same value every time you use it. Both the input you give, and the value you get, from the Riemann zeta function are special numbers called complex numbers. A complex number is a number with two parts, a real part and an imaginary part. The imaginary part is called imaginary because you would have to "imagine" such a number as formula_1 that when multiplied by itself is equal to formula_2. Because based on the rules of arithmetic formula_3 and formula_4 no such number could exist, it would have to be imagined. Imaginary numbers have vast use in mathematics; without them a lot of technologies would not be possible. As a tangible example, in order to use quadratic formula to solve some equations, the answer sometimes has to be an imaginary number, and historically this was the reason why imaginary numbers were invented in the first place.

Sometimes when you put an input into the Riemann zeta function, you get the number zero back. When this happens, you call that input a root of the Riemann zeta function. You call the input a "root" when it gives you zero. Lots of roots have been found. But some roots are easier to find than others. We call the roots "trivial" or "non-trivial". We call a root "trivial" if it is easy to find. But we call a root "non-trivial" if its hard to find. The trivial roots are numbers called "negative even integers". The reason we think they are easy is because they are easy to find. There are neat rules that say what the trivial roots are. We know what the trivial roots are because of the equation that Bernhard Riemann gave. That equation was called "Riemann's functional equation".

The non-trivial roots are harder to find. They don't have the same neat rules that say what they are. Even though they are hard to find, lots of non-trivial roots have been found. Remember that the value of the Riemann zeta function was a kind of number called a complex number. And remember that complex numbers have two parts. One of these parts is called the "real part". We noticed an interesting thing about the real part of the non-trivial roots. All the non-trivial roots we found have a real part that is the same number. This number is 1/2, which is a fraction. This takes us to Riemann's big question, which is about how big the real parts are. The question is "do all the non-trivial roots have real part 1/2?", and the hypothesis says the answer is yes. We are still trying to find out if the answer is "yes" or "no".

We do not know the answer to the question yet. But we do know some good facts. These facts might help us. There is a way we can find facts about the real parts of the non-trivial roots. This is with Riemann's special equation (Riemann's functional equation). Riemann's functional equation tells us about the size of the real parts. It says that all the non-trivial zeros have a real part close to 1/2. It says how small the real parts can be, and how big they can be. But it doesn't say "exactly" what they are. Specifically, it says the real parts have to be bigger than 0. But they have to be less than 1. But we still don't know if there might be a non-trivial root with a real part very close to 1/2. Maybe there is, but we just have not found it yet. The group of complex numbers that have a real part bigger than 0 but smaller than 1 is called the "critical strip".

The picture in the top-right corner of this page shows the Riemann zeta function. The non-trivial roots are shown with the white dots. They look like they're all in a line down the very middle of the picture. They're not too far to the left and not too far to the right. The real part is how far left-to-right you are. Being in the middle of the picture means they have a real part of 1/2. So all the non-trivial roots in the picture have a real part of 1/2. But our picture doesn't show everything because the Riemann zeta function is too big to show. So what about the non-trivial roots above and below the picture? Would they be in the middle too? What if they break the pattern of being in the middle? They could be slightly to the left or right. The Riemann hypothesis asks if "every" non-trivial root (white dot) would be on the line down the middle. If the answer is no, we say the "hypothesis is false". This would mean that there are white dots which are not on the line given.

Shot glass

A shot glass is a small cup that people use to drink alcoholic drinks with. Spirits are usually drunk out of shot glasses. A person usually swallows everything in the glass at once.

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, or RPI is a private university in Troy, NY. It was made in 1824 by Stephen Van Rensselaer because he wanted there to be schools that taught science and engineering. It is the oldest engineering school in America. Lots of students from RPI get jobs that pay a lot of money after they leave RPI. Some people who went to RPI have started big companies like NVIDIA, John Wiley and Sons, and Texas Instruments. George Low, an American who helped get spaceships into space, went to RPI.

What RPI focuses on has changed a lot since it was first made. There still is a lot of engineering at the school, but now there is growing arts and social studies teaching at the school. A big concert hall called EMPAC was opened in 2008 at RPI.

Most of RPI's sports teams play in NCAA Division III, which does not allow athletic scholarships. The men's and women's ice hockey teams play as Division I teams in ECAC Hockey. The hockey teams are can award scholarships because of a special NCAA rule.


Jack Russell Terrier

The Jack Russell Terrier is a small dog with a white coat that can be smooth or rough-coated. Some have a broken coat that is also called "wire-haired".

This terrier is good at fox hunting.

The Jack Russell terrier were originally bred in England by the Reverend John Russell from about 1819. The Jack Russell is sturdier than the standard terrier. It is a fast runner, has a great nose and can hunt the fox even when it goes underground. It can also be used as a work dog.

As with other domesticated animals, there are numerous variations. Differences in naming were caused by the different regulations of different kennel clubs. Some dog clubs make a difference between what they call "Parson Jack Russell Terriers", which are over 12" (inches) at the shoulders, and "Jack Russell Terriers" which are under 12" in height. Other clubs do not. They are broadly the same type of dog. It is easy to change the height of dogs by selective breeding, and the reason working dogs come in different sizes is to make them better at a particular job. Taller terriers were used for hunting foxes, and smaller terriers were used for hunting rabbits and rodents.



The Hound of the Baskervilles

The Hound of the Baskervilles is a novel.

Dr James Mortimor comes to Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson to seek their help with the Baskerville family of Devon. Sir Charles Baskerville, the last of his Baskerville family was an elderly man. He believed that there was a curse on the family. In 1647 his ancestor, Hugo Baskerville, had attempted to catch a young woman whom he carried off; the girl had died of fear while Hugo was killed by a gigantic hound. Sir Charles Baskerville died of a heart attack while apparently fleeing a gigantic hound. As he was unmarried with no heirs, his estate goes to his nephew, Henry Baskerville, of Canada who is arriving in London. Although Holmes is not superstitious he does decide to take the case. Upon meeting the heir, several odd things happen: an unsigned note is delivered to Henry Baskerville warning him to stay away from the moor; then Henry's shoes beginning missing and turning up; first a new shoe and then an old one; lastly Holmes spots a stranger in a cab following Henry and Dr Mortimor.

Holmes cannot go to Devon so he sends Dr Watson in his place as both a bodyguard to Sir Henry and as a spy. Dr Watson reports the eccentric happenings in Devon: the Baskerville's butler Barrymore and his wife who act strangely; Jack Stapleton an ex-schoolmaster and eccentric butterfly collector and his sister Beryl; a local busybody/and crank Frankland and his estranged daughter Laura Lyons. Lastly there is a deranged convict escapee named Sheldon on the moor. Beryl Stapleton first mistakes Watson for Sir Henry, warning him to go away; when she meets Sir Henry who begins to be attracted to her; although her brother strongly objects to their meeting together. Watson and Sir Henry find out the reason for the Barrymores strange actions, they are secretly helping Mrs Barrymore's brother, the escaped convict. Barrymore does reveal that he accidentally found a burned note to Charles Baskerville asking him to meet outside the hall from someone named L.L.

Watson confronts Laura Lyons who admits that Charles Baskerville had financed her typewriting business and says she did not meet him on the night of his death. Watson is also confronted by Franklin who claims that he saw the escaped convict on the moor hiding in a old stone hut. Watson decides to investigate and finds the stranger is none other than Holmes! Holmes reveals that his prime suspect is Stapleton, who is the husband not the brother of Beryl. When they hear a scream they run out to find a dead man at the foot of a cliff. It is Sheldon the convict who was wearing Henry Baskerville old clothes. After meeting Stapleton, Holmes and Watson go to Baskerville Hall where Holmes tells Sir Henry to keep his dinner engagement with the Stapletons for the next night, although neither Holmes or Watson can go with Sir Henry as they must leave for London. Instead of leaving for London, Holmes and Watson confront Laura Lyons who is forced to admit that Stapleton had promised marriage to her. The meeting with Sir Charles was to have been a loan connected with her divorce expenses. It was Stapleton who persuaded her not to meet with Sir Charles at the last second and also to keep quiet about the note. Holmes and Watson meet Inspector Lestrade who has a arrest warrant. That night the three men spy on Stapleton and Sir Henry; when Sir Henry leaves to walk home, a gigantic glowing hound nearly attacks him but is killed by Holmes and Watson. At Stapleton's house they find Beryl who has been tied up and beaten by Stapleton. Stapleton flees to the moor but falls into the Grimpen Mire.

Holmes reveals his deductive reasoning: the warning note had a woman's perfume scent; the theft of the shoes gave a clue that the dog was real; Stapleton, who was a spiritual and physical throwback to Hugo Baskerville (Holmes noticed the resemblance to the family portraits); his real name was Rodger Baskerville Jr (his father was the youngest of the Baskerville brothers and had to flee England for Central America). After marring a local beauty Beryl Garcia, he had stolen public money and fled Central America to England in 1885 where he used the money to start a public school in Yorkshire. The tutor he had hired died of consumption and the school which Baskerville then tried to use to teach his pupils crime was forced to close after an epidemic killed three students. In 1887 He then fled to his ancestrial home in Devon with the remains of his fortune, his wife and his taste for Entomology; Holmes cannot prove it but he theorizes that Baskerville supported himself by burglaries and in the process committed a murder. When he found out that one life was between him and a valuable estate and that Sir Charles had both a weak heart and took the family legend seriously, he bought a large savage dog and hid it on the moor. He tricked Laura Lyons into writing the appointment note for Sir Charles and sent the dog, coated with phosphorous, after the old man who died of a heart attack. He tried the same trick on his cousin Henry twice-the first time however it was the convict wearing Henry clothing that fell victim. He had tied up his wife so she could not warn Sir Henry of the danger he was in. In Holmes words: Roger Baskerville aka Jack Stapleton has for years been a dangerous and desperate man and one of the few foes worthy of confronting Sherlock Holmes The others being Dr Grimesby Roylott and Professor Moriaty).


Mach number

A mach number is a number that describes speed. It is a measure of the speed of an object compared to the speed of sound. Mach number is given as a percentage compared to the local speed of sound. For example, half the speed of sound = Mach 0.5.

formula_1 

Where v is the speed of the object, and a is the speed of sound.

It is named after the Austrian physicist Ernst Mach. When writing a speed as a Mach number, the number comes after "Mach." For example, the Concorde airplane could fly at Mach 2, and a satellite re-enters the Earth's atmosphere at about Mach 25.

Flying speed less than Mach 0.8 is called subsonic. Almost all airplanes, helicopters, and other aircraft are subsonic.

Flying speed from Mach 0.8 to Mach 1.2 is called transonic. If an airplane is moving at this speed, then some of the air around it moves faster than the speed of sound, but some of the air moves slower than the speed of sound.

Flying speed from Mach 1.2 to Mach 5 is called supersonic. An aircraft moving at this speed makes a shock wave. This can be heard as a very loud sound called a sonic boom. Supersonic aircraft are used in war, as fighter jets. Today, there are no supersonic aircraft for passenger use. There were some in the past, mainly the Concorde.

Flying speed above Mach 5 is called hypersonic.

Transonic

Transonic means breaking the sound barrier by travelling faster than the speed of sound (1,236 kph or 768 mph).

The speed of flight is divided into four groups based on speed.

Transonic means going from subsonic to supersonic. Subsonic ends and supersonic begins at mach 1, so transonic goes from mach 0.8 to 1.2. When you are going through transonic speeds, drag increases and it is really hard to go any faster. This is the sound barrier.

Massively multiplayer online game

Massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) are video games where players play together over the internet. These games are different from other online video games because they have very many players all playing with each other at the same time. Other online video games have fewer players playing with each other at the same time. The most popular kind of MMOG is the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). Examples are "RuneScape", "World of Warcraft" (WOW), "Roblox" and "Transformice".


Baton

A baton is a stick. Different batons are used by different people, for different things.

Policemen often carry batons, which can be used as weapons. These batons are also sometimes called "nightsticks."

Runners pass batons to one another in relay races.

Musical conductors use batons to lead an orchestra.

Various people in a parade or marching band might twirl batons for people to see.

Mark D. Maughmer

Mark D. Maughmer (born January 18, 1947) is a Professor of Aerospace Engineering in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the Pennsylvania State University. He is famous for designing the first type of airplane wing tips for better glider performance. He has won many awards for being a good teacher and for having an influence in aerospace.

Triskaidekaphobia

Triskaidekaphobia is the fear of the number thirteen. The number 13 has been linked to bad luck in the western superstition. Some buildings in the United States do not have a "13th floor."

The term was first used by Isador Coriat in "Abnormal Psychology".

There is also a fear of Friday the 13th. This fear is called "paraskevidekatriaphobia" or "friggatriskaidekaphobia".

Magnoliales

Magnoliales is an order of flowering plants. They are very successful, despite being an early type of flowering plant.

The Magloliales includes six families:

Magnoliaceae

The Magnoliaceae, or Magnolia Family, is a flowering plant family in the order Magnoliales. The family has about 225 species in 7 genera. 

Bobsleigh

Bobsled or bobsleigh is a team sport played during the Winter Olympic Games. It is played by riding on iced tracks with a sled. Modern tracks are made of concrete, coated with ice. Artificial bobsleigh tracks are also available.

International bobsled competitions are governed by the Fédération Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing (FIBT).

The first bobsleds were built in St. Moritz, Switzerland, in the late 19th century by rich tourists from Britain who were staying at the Palace Hotel owned by Caspar Badrutt.



Pulp (band)

Pulp were a English band from Sheffield, South Yorkshire. The lead singer, Jarvis Cocker, started the band in 1978. For a long time, Cocker found life as a musician hard. However, in 1994, he and his band became famous when their album called his ""His and Hers"" became popular in the United Kingdom. They had three more albums and a number of singles before the band split up in 2001. 

1983 - It 
1987 - Freaks 
1992 - Separations 
1994 - His 'N' Hers (Number 9 in the UK music charts) 
1995 - Different Class (Number 1 in the UK music charts) 
1996 - Countdown 1992-1983 (Number 10 in the UK music charts) 
1998 - This Is Hardcore (Number 1 in the UK music charts) 
2001 - We Love Life (Number 6 in the UK music charts)

+44 (band)

The +44, or Plus 44, was a punk rock group that formed in 2004. It was started by former Blink-182 members Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker, with guitarist Craig Fairbaugh from the band Transplants, and Shane Gallagher from the Nervous Return. The name of the band is the title of the telephone code for the UK, +44. The band broke up on January 13, 2009, when Blink-182 reformed.



Johns Hopkins University

The Johns Hopkins University is a private research university in Baltimore, Maryland in the United States of America. Johns Hopkins opened in 1876 as part of a seven million dollar donation to start a number of institutions under his name. Johns Hopkins does more than 1.5 billion dollars of science research every year. During the pandemic, the university has been doing researching on the outbreak.


Trap door

A trap door or trapdoor is a door in the ground or in a floor, that one enters vertically. Some can open when someone is standing on it. People typically put small doors disguised as something normal to scare a person falling into a trapdoor. They can be used for malicious purposes like murder. However, they can be used to hide things from other people. 

Trap doors are popular in mystery themed movies. The victim who falls down the trap door often is met with danger or a hidden treasure. A standard cliché deals with the victim finding himself in an alligator filled swamp (most famously seen in "Scooby Doo" cartoons).

Pane sciocco

Pane sciocco (also called in Tuscany "pane toscano") is a variety of bread very common in Tuscany and in Umbria, two regions in Italy. Pane sciocco does not contain salt, because when it was first made in the 1600s, salt was very rare and very expensive. Pane sciocco is often eaten with typically Tuscan ham or sausages, famous for being salty.


Lobotomy

Lobotomy, also known as leucotomy, is a type of brain surgery. It was created in 1935 by António Egas Moniz, a Portuguese neurologist. He won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1949 "for his discovery of the therapeutic value of leucotomy in certain psychoses". The operation cut the connections from the pre-frontal cortex (front part of the frontal lobes) to the rest of the brain. At first it seemed a great success, but the operation is now rarely done.

He used the method for certain types of mental illness for which there was no other treatment. He first used it on patients with obsessive behaviour, which they repeated time and again. It was also used to treat other mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia and clinical depression. 

The problem with lobotomies was that they forever changed a person's personality and behaviour. Sometimes, the results were beneficial: patients which had been violent became calm. But long-term studies, which were not done by Moniz, show some had severely damaged personalities. They often had very little 'drive' and motivation.

Today, antipsychotic drugs, like chlorpromazine, may treat the symptoms of such disorders. Lobotomies are not common today.

One question is why was such a dramatic surgical technique so widely accepted. It is generally agreed that psychiatrists wanted to find some way of helping thousands of patients in psychiatric hospitals in the twentieth century. Also, those same patients had little power to resist the increasingly radical and even reckless interventions of asylum doctors.

According to the "Psychiatric Dictionary" in 1970:

Good results are obtained in about 40 percent of cases, fair results in some 35 percent and poor results in 25 percent. The mortality rate probably does not exceed 3 percent. Greatest improvement is seen in patients whose premorbid personalities were 'normal', cyclothymic, or obsessive compulsive; in patients with superior intelligence and good education; in psychoses with sudden onset and a clinical picture of affective symptoms of depression or anxiety, and with behaviouristic changes such as refusal of food, overactivity, and delusional ideas of a paranoid nature. 

According to the same source, prefrontal lobotomy reduces:
anxiety feelings and introspective activities; and feelings of inadequacy and self-consciousness are thereby lessened. Lobotomy reduces the emotional tension associated with hallucinations and does away with the catatonic state. Because nearly all psychosurgical procedures have undesirable side effects, they are ordinarily resorted to only after all other methods have failed. The less disorganized the personality of the patient, the more obvious are post-operative side effects. ... 

Convulsive seizures are reported as [effects] of prefrontal lobotomy in 5 to 10 percent of all cases. Such seizures are ordinarily well controlled with the usual anti-convulsive drugs. Post-operative blunting of the personality, apathy, and irresponsibility are the rule rather than the exception. Other side effects include distractibility, childishness, facetiousness, lack of tact or discipline, and post-operative incontinence.


The Black Pearl (Scott O'Dell)

The Black Pearl is a book for teens by Scott O'Dell first published in 1967. It is about the son of a pearl dealer living in the Lower California peninsula. It won the Newbery Honor in 1968.

The story is about a Mexican teenager named Ramon Salazar who works with his father finding and selling pearls. One day, Ramon went diving in an underwater cave in search of pearls and found a pearl bigger than his fist. It was so shiny and big that he thought that it was called the Pearl of Heaven. The pearl was found in a lagoon that belonged to an Indian who warned Ramon that the pearl belonged to the Manta Diablo.

In 1977, Saul Swimmer directed the U.S.-Spanish co-production "The Black Pearl," also known in Spanish as "La Perla Negra".
