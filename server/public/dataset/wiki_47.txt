Carter Lake is an example of the border irregularities of the United States. It is the only city in Iowa that is west of the Missouri River. In March 1877, a flood changed the course of the river 1.25 mi (2 km) to the southeast. The parts of the old river course, called Saratoga Bend, became an oxbow lake. It is named Carter Lake. After the creation of the lake, the place became a recreational area. It included "a boathouse at the foot of Locust street, hotels and club houses were numerous and the lake was the scene of many a pleasant rowing and fishing party."

In 1892, after a lot of litigation between Iowa and Nebraska, the Supreme Court of the United States said that Carter Lake is part of Iowa in "Nebraska v. Iowa", 143 U.S. 359 (1892). The general rule is that state borders follow small changes in the course of a river. However, the Court said that an there's an exception when a river avulses one of its bends. In 1972, the Supreme Court made another ruling about Carter Lake when it ruled on a border dispute between the two states in "Nebraska v. Iowa", 406 U.S. 117 (1972).

Fonda, Iowa

Fonda is a city in Pocahontas County, Iowa, United States. The population was 636 at the time of the 2020 census.

The city of Fonda was originally called Marvin. Marvin, however, was too similar to Manson, Iowa and since kept mail being mixed up, town officials changed the name to Fonda in 1874. The nearest municipality sharing the name, "Fonda", is Fonda, New York.

Fonda is located at (42.582819, -94.845810).

The United States Census Bureau states that the city has a total area of , all land.

The town is placed at the western edge of the Des Moines Lobe, the more recently glaciated section of Iowa. The Des Moines Lobe is part of the prairie pothole region of the Midwest. The topography is not normal in its softly rolling terrain. Wetlands, glacial erratics, bands of ridges, and large flat areas characterize the land surrounding Fonda. In its natural state, the land is poorly drained, although humans have added an extensive network of tiles to move water from the potholes to local tributaries. The tiles surrounding Fonda empty into Big Cedar Creek, a tributary of the Raccoon River. This waterway, which underwent channelization in the early 1900s, flows past the town on its west end. Evidence of its winding original path still exists, particularly in the Fonda Golf Course and in the schoolyard behind Our Lady of Good Counsel Catholic Church.

Four miles (6  km) northwest of town, Sunken Grove Wildlife Management Area (WMA) exists as a reminder of the past. Large undrained wetlands are surrounded by forests and prairies. The area is home to large populations of migrating birds and permanent populations of wildlife. This public parcel has recently expanded and is adjacent to the Leo Shimon WMA. Together, the two areas comprise of land, a total of slightly less than two square miles.

The remainder of the area surrounding Fonda is agricultural. Vast corn and soybean fields are interspersed by acreages and hog confinements (also known as a concentrated animal feeding operation). The vitality of the town and of the region have been influenced by the shift from a sustenance way of farming to an industrial model. Fewer farmers, less diversity in agricultural products, more agrochemicals, and more tillage have upset the economic system of the town and surrounding countryside. Fonda's AgPartners elevator is partially owned by Cargill. Many of the hog confinements around town are owned by corporations, such as New Fashion Pork, based in Jackson, Minnesota.

Pocahontas County has seen a large decrease in the number of farms. In 1969, there were 1,369 farms. By 1997 the number had dropped to 778. The average farm size has increased from 265 to 459 acres (107 to 186 hectares) in that same time period. In 1969, 844 farms sold 176,705 hogs. In 1997, 162 farms sold 248,666 hogs.

In 1982, 14 poultry farms housed 69,911 layers. By 1997, no farms and no layers existed. In 1982, there were of pastures and acreages in the county. By 1997, that amount had decreased to .

Des Moines, which lies south and east of Fonda, receives a large portion of its drinking water from the Raccoon River (and thus Big Cedar Creek). From 1978 to 2004, contamination at its water intake plant due to nitrates (an agrichemical) has increased from 4.5 mg/L to 7.7 mg/L. Nitrate consumption is linked to blue baby syndrome.

Fonda has seen a steady decrease in its population in recent decades. In 1980, the town had 863 residents, and in 1990 there were 731.

Death's-head hawkmoth

A Death's-head hawkmoth may be one of three types of moth. The ("A. atropos", "A. styx" and "A. lachesis"), and are in the genus Acherontia. The most common usage of the name is for the Europen species.

"A. atropos" are usually in Europe, but "A. styx" and "A. lachesis" live in Asia. The name comes from skull-shaped pattern of markings on the thorax. All three species are about the same in size, coloration, and life cycle.

These moths have many unusual features. All three species can make a loud squeak if irritated. The sound is made by moving air from the pharynx, often along with the flashing of the brightly-colored abdomen in a further attempt to deter predators. All three species raid beehives of different species of honey bee for honey, but "A. atropos" only attacks colonies of the well-known western honey bee, "Apis mellifera". They are able to move about in hives unhurt because they mimic the scent of the bees.

Eggs are laid one by one under old leaves of the hostplant, and are green or grey-blue. None of the three species are forced to use a single family of host plant. Many of the types of plants used are in the families Solanaceae, Verbenaceae, Oleaceae, Bignoniaceae, and others. The larvae are strong, reaching 120-130 mm, with a tail horn that stands out or can be seen easily. All three species have three larval color forms: usually green, brown, or yellow. Larvae do not move much, and will click their mandibles or even bite if threatened. When mature, they burrow underground and excavate a small chamber where they pupate.

This moth was used in the movie "The Silence of the Lambs". It was also referenced in "I'm the King of the Castle."

Post Office Protocol

In computing, the Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) is an application-layer Internet standard protocol used by local e-mail clients to get e-mail from a remote mail server over a TCP/IP connection. POP3 and IMAP4 (Internet Message Access Protocol) are the two most widely accepted Internet standard protocols for e-mail retrieval. Almost all modern e-mail clients and servers support both.

Many years ago, a proposal was outlined for a POP4 specification, complete with a working server implementation. The proposed POP4 extension adds basic folder management, multipart message support, as well as message flag management, allowing for a light protocol which supports some popular IMAP features which POP3 lacks. No progress has been found in the POP4 specification since 2003.

Andriy Shevchenko

Andriy Shevchenko (, born 29 September 1976) is a former Ukrainian football player and former politician. He is current football manager. He played for Dynamo Kyiv, Milan and Chelsea football teams. He was the captain of Ukrainian national football team.

Shevchenko is among top goalscorer in all European competitions.

Andriy Shevchenko was born in the village of Dvirkivshchyna, Yahotyn district, Kyiv region. Three years after the birth of their son, the Shevchenko family moved to Kyiv, to the Obolon district. There Andrew went to the first class of the 216th high school. At the age of 9 he got into the football section. The first coach is Alexander Shpakov. Parents were initially skeptical of their child's fascination, but the coach was able to convince them.

In 1990, the 14-year-old Dynamo won the Ian Rush Cup in Wales, and Shevchenko became the tournament's top scorer and received a pair of boots from Ian Rush himself. In 1991, the "Dynamo" boys won the USSR championship among boys born in 1976. The team traveled to international tournaments in Europe, including the San Siro in Milan.

Andriy Shevchenko's first appearance in adult football took place in the 1992/93 season. With 12 goals, he became the top scorer of the first league team "Dynamo-2". Then he was invited to the Olympic team of Ukraine, and he appeared in the major leagues. He was first replaced on November 8, 1994 (the game with Shakhtar). At that time, the Dynamo team was coached by Jozef Szabo.

On February 16, 2016, he joined the coaching staff of the national team of Ukraine headed by Mykhailo Fomenko. The first match of the Shevchenko-coach was a friendly game of the national team of Ukraine against the national team of Cyprus, in which the Ukrainians won. He was in the coaching staff during Euro 2016. After the tournament, he became the head coach of the national team of Ukraine. His coaching staff included several foreign experts, including Italians Andrea Mulder and Mauro Tasotti. Mykola Vasylkov, a well-known Ukrainian TV presenter, journalist, and school friend of Shevchenko, became an adviser to the coaching staff on publicity issues.

In July 2016, Shevchenko announced that he would give up a friendly match with the Georgian national team before qualifying for the 2018 World Cup. In the end, Ukraine took third place in the group, beating the teams of Iceland and Croatia.

Despite the failure in the selection for the 2018 World Cup, Andriy's contract with the national team of Ukraine was extended.

In 1998, Shevchenko joined the SDPU (O). And, as Viktor Medvedchuk claimed in an interview with Ukrayinska Pravda, he remained a member until at least mid-June 2005. In the elections to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on October 28, 2012, Andriy Shevchenko became the second number in the list of Natalia Korolevska's party "Ukraine - Forward!" and contributed 10 million hryvnias in support of this political force. Despite this, the party "Ukraine - Forward!" did not get into parliament, gaining 322,198 votes in Ukraine, or 1.58% of the total number of people who took part in the election.

In May 2018, he signed a letter demanding the release of Ukrainian director Oleg Sentsov, a prisoner in Russia.


Megapode

The megapodes, also known as incubator birds or mound-builders, are stocky, medium-large chicken-like birds with small heads and large feet. They are included in the family of Megapodidae. They may build a pile of rotting vegetables as an incubator for their eggs.

Super Bowl XXXVII

Super Bowl XXXVII was the thirty-seventh Super Bowl to happen. It featured a match between the NFC Champions, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the AFC Champions, the Oakland Raiders. Tampa Bay won the game 48-21. The halftime show featured Shania Twain, No Doubt and Sting.

Lysosome

A lysosome is a cell organelle. They are like spheres and they have hydrolytic enzymes which can break down almost all kinds of biomolecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids, and cellular debris. They contain more than 50 different enzymes.

By convention, lysosome is the term used for animal cells. In plant cells, vacuoles do similar functions. With a wider definition, lysosomes are 
found in the cytoplasm of plant and protists as well as animal cell. 

Lysosomes work like the digestive system to break down, or digest, proteins, acids, carbohydrates, dead organelles, and other unwanted materials. They break up larger molecules into smaller molecules. Those smaller molecules can then be used again as building blocks for other large molecules.Sometimes, when the cell itself is dying or is dead the lysosomes will eat up the cell. This is why they are also known as 'suicide bags' of cells.

Acherontia atropos

Acherontia atropos is the most widely-known of the three species of Death's-head Hawkmoth.

"A. atropos" has a wingspan of 10 to 13 cm (3.9 to 5.1 in). The top wings are mainly dark brown or black. They are powdered with white. There are many black and dark red stripes. There is a small white spot in the center of each top wing. The bottom wing is yellow or yellow-brown. There are two black lines near the edge of each wing. The head and thorax are dark brown or black. They are the same color as the top wings. The thorax has a dark brown spot that looks like a human skull. This is where the moth gets its name. However, some individuals do not have this spot. The abdomen is blackish-blue. There is a row of yellow spots on each side of the abdomen.

It is found from northern Africa to the Middle East. It can be found as far north as southern Great Britain. It can also be found on the Canary Islands, Madeira, and the Azores.

"A. atropos" is in its normal range from March to September. However, they will sometimes be seen as early as February and as late as October. They have many broods (a brood is a group of offspring) each year.

"A. atropos" can make a loud cry if it is attacked by predators. It can make this sound by pushing air out of its proboscis (the proboscis is the moth's mouth). If this does not scare the predator away, it will quickly flash its abdomen, showing the yellow spots.

"A. atropos" is most active from evening to after midnight. It is attracted to lights. It will feed on the nectar of Potato, Tobacco, Sweet William, and Orange blossoms.

At night, "A. atropos" will raid beehives. It will only attack Western honey bee beehives. "A. atropos" is attacked at the entrance by guard bees. However, "A atropos" is immune to the bees' venom. The moth also can mimic the bees' scent. "A. atropos" feeds on the honey. It will break through the honeycombs with its sharp proboscis.

Female "A. Atropos" will lay one egg per host plant (the host plant is the plant that the caterpillar feeds on). She will lay them on the underside of the leaves. The egg is green or a gray-blue color. It will turn to a yellowish color just before hatching.

The newly hatched caterpillar is yellow-green. It has a very long, black horn on the end of the abdomen. After it sheds its skin, it becomes greener. It has yellow stripes on each side of the body. There are many small white and yellow bumps on the body. After it sheds its skin a second time, the yellow stripes have blue or purple edges. The horn is yellow-green, with the bottom part being black. After it sheds its skin for the third time, the caterpillar becomes more yellow. There is a row of black spots along each side of the body. The blue or purple edges on the yellow stripes become thicker. After it sheds its skin for the last time, it becomes even more yellow. All of the colors are brighter. There are no longer any bumps on the body. The horn is now yellow. It points downward. The horn has many little bumps on it. It will reach a length of about 13 cm (5.1 in).

Before it turns into a chrysalis, the caterpillar will darken. It will also cover itself with saliva. This makes the caterpillar darken even faster. Once this is done, it will look for a good place to pupate (pupate means to turn into a pupa).

The caterpillars do not move very much. They will only move to find fresh leaves. If a caterpillar is attacked, it will make sounds with its mandibles. They will also bite very hard if attacked.

The caterpillar will pupate 15 to 40 cm (5.9 to 15.7 in) deep in the ground. The chrysalis is a shiny brown. It is 7.5 to 8 cm (2.9 to 3.1 in) long. If attacked, the chrysalis can move. The chrysalis hibernates. However, "A. Atropos" will sometimes hibernate as a caterpillar. "A. Atropos" does not live through the winter in Europe.

Here is a list of host plants used by "A. atropos":


Acherontia styx

Acherontia styx is a Sphingid moth found in Asia, one of the three species of Death's-head Hawkmoth, also known as the "Bee Robber".

An "Acherontia styx" pupa found in the soft palate of a murder victim is a vital clue in the thriller novel The Silence of the Lambs; in "The Silence of the Lambs" movie version, however, while the script still refers to "styx", the species used is "Acherontia atropos".

Acherontia lachesis

Acherontia lachesis is a large (up to 13 cm wingspan) Sphingid moth found in India and much of the Oriental region, one of the three species of Death's-head Hawkmoth, also known as the "Bee Robber".
<br>

Xylophanes amadis

Xylophanes amadis is large moth of the Family Sphingidae. It is found in Surinam, and westward through Guyana, Venezuela and Bolivia.


Territory

A territory (plural: territories, from the word "terra", which means 'land') is an area which belongs to a person, organization, institution, animal, nation or state. In international law, a "territory" is an area of land which is outside the borders of a nation, but owned by that nation. Examples are: Puerto Rico as a U.S. territory, or Bermuda as a territory of the UK.

General examples of territories are states controlled by a federated government (such as Germany or the counties of a state within the States of the United States), a unitary state such as France, an occupied territory (land which has been invaded by the military of another country) or a disputed territory (such as Kashmir, which both India and Pakistan believe is theirs).

Sphingidae

Sphingidae is a family of moths (Lepidoptera), commonly known as hawk moths, sphinx moths and hornworms. It includes about 1,450 species. It is best represented in the tropics but there are species in every region.

They can fly fast, and their wings can be linked by wing coupling. They can hover, and can move from side to side while hovering. This may be to deal with ambush predators that lie in wait in flowers.

There are around 1200 species of hawk moth, classified into around 200 genera. Some of the best known species are:

Acosmeryx socrates

Acosmeryx socrates is a moth of the Sphingidae family. It lives in southeast Asia.

Isognathus rimosus

The Rimosus Sphinx ("Isognathus rimosa") is a moth of the Sphingidae family. It lives in tropical climates from northern Brazil north through Central America, the West Indies and Mexico to southern Arizona.

The wingspan is 70-102 mm.


Scarlino

Scarlino is a "comune" (municipality) in the Province of Grosseto in the Italian region Tuscany. It is about southwest of Florence and about northwest of Grosseto.

Scarlino borders the following municipalities: Castiglione della Pescaia, Follonica, Gavorrano, Massa Marittima.

Scarlino was at first under the control of the Aldobrandeschi family, later under the bishops of Roselle and then the Alberti family. In the 13th century it was bought again by the Aldobrandeschi, but later it passed to Pisa and then the Appiani of Piombino.

Until the early 19th century, Scarlino was still a part of the Principality of Piombino. Later it became part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.



Takin

The Takin ("Budorcas taxicolor") is a goat-antelope found in the Eastern Himalayas, Sikkim, northern Assam, northern Burma, and central and southern China. The takin is the national animal of Bhutan.

Ryanair

Ryanair is an Irish low-cost airline. It was started in 1985. It is based in Dublin Airport and London Stansted Airport. Ryanair goes to 165 cities. These are mostly across Europe. Ryanair has a fleet of 505 Boeing 737 aircraft. 



Ford Crown Victoria

The Ford Crown Victoria was a large, rear-wheel drive car. It was the last big, V8, RWD sedan made by an American automobile company. In the 1980s, it was called the LTD Crown Victoria. Back then, it also came as a station wagon called the Country Squire. It was redesigned in early 1991 for the 1992 model year when it became the Crown Victoria and saw the station wagon axed due to falling demand. It was redesigned for the 1998 model year. It has been widely used by both the general public as well as large businesses, government and law enforcement bodies. In 2008 Ford made the Crown Victoria "fleet-only", meaning they would no longer sell them one by one to the general public but could be obtained as used models. They are most commonly seen as police cars and taxis. The Crown Victoria also has the distinction of being the last car Ford sold with an analogue odometer when it was updated for the 2006 model year. It was discontinued after the 2011 model year without a direct replacement. 



Mira

Mira is a binary star system with a white dwarf (Mira B, also known as VZ Ceti) star and a red giant (Mira A). Scientists think Mira is 200-400 light years away in the constellation Cetus. Mira A is a variable star, changing its size and brightness. Other red giant stars that do the same are called Mira variables. 
Mira has a diameter 332 to 541 times that of our sun.

If Mira's size was constant, then its diameter would be only 240 times larger than the Sun.

Ferry Corsten

Ferry Corsten, also known as System F, (born 4 December 1973) is a Dutch musical artist. He creates music in the electronica and trance varieties. He lives in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Ferry hosts his own radio show, "Corsten's Countdown".

In 2009 Corsten ranked #7 on DJ Magazine's annual Top 100 DJ Poll.

Mimicry

In biology, mimicry is when a species evolves features similar to another. Either one or both are protected when a third species cannot tell them apart. Often, these features are visual; one species looks like another; but similarities of sound, smell and behaviour may also make the fraud seem more real. 

Mimicry is related to camouflage, and to warning signals, in which species manipulate or deceive other species which might do them harm. Although mimicry is mainly a defence against predators, sometimes predators also use mimicry, and fool their prey into feeling safe.

Mimicry happens in both animal and plant species. The "mimic" is the species which looks like the "model". The model may be living, or not. Whole groups of animals go in for mimicry as a life style, such as mantids, leaf insects or stick insects. Camouflage, in which a species looks similar to its surroundings, is a form of visual mimicry.

There are far more insect mimics than any other class of animal, but then there are far more insects than other types of animals. Indeed, 75% of all animals which have been described and named, are insects. Many other kinds of animal mimics are known, including fish, plants and even fungi, though less research has been done on these.

Mimicry evolves because the species that are better at mimicking survive to produce more offspring than the species that are worse at mimicking. The genes of the better mimics become more common in the species. Over time, mimic species get closer to their models. This is the process of evolution by natural selection.

Since most higher animals have relatively good eyesight, they use it to find what they want. Both herbivores (animals which eat plants), and predators (animals which hunt and eat other animals), use sight to find their food. Prey need to avoid being eaten by predators. Their best chance is to avoid being seen. Usually, they need camouflage. With camouflage, an animal looks like its background, and so is more difficult to see. This is achieved in various ways: 

Both camouflage and mimicry work best when a predator is searching from a distance. When the predator gets close to the prey, and they are sure to be found, some prey switch methods, and flee (run away) or fight back. This behaviour is almost always instinctive. In any event, whether cryptic (hidden) or not, the prey's behaviour must match its mimicry. If it looks like a leaf twisting in the wind, then it has to twist in the wind. Almost all forms of mimicry involve appropriate behaviour to reinforce the visual impression.

Not all animals use camouflage because there are situations where it is good to show themselves off. One case is the need to find and keep a mate. Many male animals have some bright colors during the mating season, or change their behaviour and come out into the open. Without this, they might not succeed in mating. Their females, on the other hand, are usually dowdy and camouflaged. This pattern occurs in almost all animals where the male displays and the female chooses. There is at least one good reason the female stays camouflaged. The moment she is fertilized she carries the precious cargo: the eggs that will form part of the next generation. 

Animals that are dangerous, or foul to eat, usually advertise the fact. This is called warning or "aposematic coloration". It is the exact opposite of camouflage. Warning colors are vivid, often some of black, white, red, yellow. 

Tests show that warning colors definitely do deter predators.

Some individual animals will die or receive damage while birds or mammals on the attack learn about the connection between color and taste. However, if warning costs less than hiding, the animal benefits. And the advertising traits such as colors may serve other functions as well. The patterns may help mate identification within the species, for instance.

The fact that some animals are genuinely dangerous or noxious (disgusting) to eat gives the opportunity for mimicry based on warning coloration: Müllerian and Batesian mimicry.

In Müllerian mimicry, some species with warning coloration come to look like each other. English naturalist Henry Walter Bates first noticed that some distasteful butterflies resembled one another, which he wrote about in 1862. However, he did not give a good explanation; that was left to German naturalist Fritz Müller in 1878. Müller's explanation was simple: "Both species benefit from a common pattern". They share the cost of predators learning of their foul taste. Only one learning experience per predator might well be enough to deter it from eating both species. 

The butterflies Bates, Wallace and Müller watched and collected were brightly colored and slow-moving. They often flew in groups which were highly visible. Despite this, they were avoided by birds. This is typical of aposematic (warning) coloration. The coloring of some species from the same area was so perfect that even experienced naturalists could not tell them apart on the wing. 

Once they were collected, and set out on a board so the details could be seen, it became clear they were not all of the same species, and often not from the same biological families. The similar warning colors of hornets, wasps and some bees is Müllerian if they live in the same geographical region, so that a predator might, before learning, choose any of them.

Tests show that birds do learn what to eat by sampling when they are young. All aspects of this situation have been the subject of research. Field and experimental work on these ideas continues to this day.

In Batesian mimicry, the mimic is a "sheep in wolf's clothing": it looks like something dangerous or which tastes disgusting, but in reality it is good to eat. As he was exploring the Amazon valley in the 1850s, Bates collected butterflies. He saw how some harmless butterflies looked like other species which were toxic. Birds avoided them, so "the mimics survived even though they were good food". This was the first scientific account of mimicry.

Hoverflies often visit flowers to feed on nectar. They are harmless insects which often mimic wasps and bees. They also fly in a slow, erratic fashion, rather like wasps and bees. Often their mimicry is not perfect, and you can easily tell them apart once they have settled. However, even an imperfect mimic might cause a bird to hesitate, and that may save their life.

Biologists still do research on Batesian and Müllerian mimicry. They study how the models differ in their foul taste; and what happens when the ratio of mimics to models varies. Quite often, it is only the female which is a mimic; the male carries the normal appearance of its genus. The females need more protection, while the males need to mate. A more subtle reason is that it halves the number of mimics, and so bolsters the effectiveness of the mimicry. Batesian mimicry might damage the warning effect if the frequency of mimics became high, because more young birds would taste them and be encouraged to try again. "The benefit of warning declines if there are more mimics". 

This may explain cases such as "Papilio dardanus", an African swallowtail, whose females mimic a number of unpalatable species from the Danaidae: survival is higher when each mimetic form is rare relative to its model. The advantage is probably greater for the females, because males do not show the mimetic patterns; sexual selection probably helps to maintain this difference. These, and other issues, have been researched for many years. 

With this type of insect the life is split into stages (see complete metamorphosis). The larva is the growth stage, the adult is the reproductive stage. The larvae, too, show camouflage, aposematic color and mimicry. It is the larvae that pick up the offensive chemicals from the plants they feed on. However, larvae do not show differences between male and female, because reproduction is not their function. 

In tropical countries, field research has shown that there are large numbers of species involved in mimicry. 54 species of "Heliconius" are recognised, with over 700 named color forms. There are four (or perhaps five) assemblages of butterflies, which include the heliconiines and their mimics. These 'mimicry rings' are called "tiger", "red", "blue" and "orange" for short. Members of each ring tend to roost together at night, fly to similar habitats and at the same time of year. Mimicry rings include both Müllerian and Batesian mimicry.

Vavilovian mimicry occurs in plants where a weed comes to look like a crop plant. It is named after Nikolai Vavilov, a Russian plant breeder who discovered the idea. Before herbicides, weeds were plucked by hand. This has been done for thousands of years. The weeds come to look like the crop because the weeders pick those weeds which look most different. Vavilovian mimicry is caused by unintentional selection by humans. The weeds that survive pass on their genes. Gradually, all the weeds look more like the crop plant.

An example is rye, a common Mediterranean species. Rye was originally just a weed growing with wheat and barley. Weeding made it like the crop. Like wheat, it came to have larger seeds and more rigid spindles to which the seeds are attached. Rye is a tougher plant than wheat: it survives in harsher conditions. Having become a crop like the wheat, rye was able to become a crop plant in harsh areas, such as hills and mountains.

This type of mimicry is quite common. It is the bible metaphor of the "wolf in sheep's clothing". The mimicry works to entice a victim, who is then eaten, or otherwise taken advantage of. Angler fish, insectivorous plants and the cuckoo are all examples. All these groups are widespread, and there is no doubt that the aggressive mimicry is a successful life-style.

The next two examples introduce another metaphor, that of the "siren". The Australian katydid "Chlorobalius leucoviridis" can attract male cicadas by imitating the species-specific reply clicks of sexually receptive female cicadas. Playback experiments show that "C. leucoviridis" is able to attract males of many cicada species, even though cicada mating signals are species-specific.
Female fireflies of the genus "Photuris" emit the same light signals that females of other genera use as a mating signal. Further research showed male fireflies from several different genera are attracted to these mimics, and are subsequently captured and eaten. Female signals are based on that received from the male, each female having a repertoire of signals matching the delay and duration of the female of the corresponding species.
Luring is not a necessary condition however, as the predator may have a significant advantage by not being identified as such. They may resemble a mutualistic symbiont or a species of little relevance to the prey.

Aggressive mimicry may be used by some parasites as a means of getting to their next host. A parasitic trematode (flatworm) lives in the gut of songbirds. Their eggs pass out, and are then eaten by a snail which lives in moist environments. The eggs develop into larvae inside this second host. Unlike related species, these larvae are brightly colored and able to pulsate. A sac full of spores forces its way into the snail's eye stalks, and pulsates at high speed. This causes the tentacle to enlarge. It also affects the host's behaviour: the snail moves towards light, which it usually avoids. These factors make the sporocysts highly conspicuous, and they are soon eaten by a hungry songbird. The snail then regenerates its eye stalks, and carries on with its life cycle.

Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin. Some allow the cleaner to go inside their mouth to hunt these parasites. One species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse ("Labroides dimidiatus"), shown to the right cleaning a grouper, lives in coral reefs in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It is recognized by other fish who allow it to clean them. 

Its imposter, the mimetic sabre-toothed blenny ("Aspidontus taeniatus"), also lives in the Indian Ocean. It not only looks like the wrasse in terms of size and color, but even mimics the cleaner's 'dance'. After fooling its prey into letting its guard down, the blenny then bites it, tearing off a piece of its fin before fleeing the scene. Fish attacked in this manner soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close they become much more cautious of the model as well. Due to victim's ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.

A phenomenon sometimes called "auto-mimicry" is when the model belongs to the same species as the mimic. An example is the monarch butterfly "Danaus plexippus", which feeds on milkweed plants. The butterflies store toxins from the plant, which they maintain even in their adult forms. As the levels of toxin vary depending on diet during the larval stage, some monarchs will be more toxic than others.

Less palatable individuals can be thought of as mimics of the more dangerous individuals. They carry exactly the same warning colors as the more toxic individuals, but their punishment for predators is weaker. In species where one sex may be more of a threat than the other, if the two sexes look alike one can protect the other. Evidence came from a monkey from Gabon, which regularly ate male moths of the genus "Anaphe", but promptly stopped after it tasted a noxious female.

It is common for small prey animals to make their head less visible. Some also make the least vital part of their body look like a head. This, like the eye-spots on some butterflies, is a deflection technique. A peck or bite on the false head will just be an inconvenience, whereas a peck on the head would be fatal.

Many animals use more than one type of mimicry. This is seen in butterflies, who usually rest with wings folded upwards. They usually have different patterns on the underside of wings. The underside may be cryptic, while the upper side has some warning pattern. Moths, which rest with wings horizontal, may have different patterns on the rear wings. The rear wings are normally covered by the front wings at rest, but can be revealed if the moth is disturbed. This tactic occurs in moths which are active in daytime or twilight. The scarlet tiger moth uses both camouflage and warning color according to its situation. It is a fine example of how behaviour and mimicry work together.

The earliest known example of leaf mimicry among insects has been found in the Middle Jurassic of 165 million years ago. The insects are lacewings (Neuroptera), and the leaves are from cycads or related gymnosperms. This is interesting because it shows this type of mimicry evolved long before flowering plants arose.




Beehive

A beehive is a structure in which some species of honey bees (genus "Apis") live and raise their young. Natural beehives (or "nests") are made by honey bee colonies, while domesticated honey bees are kept in man-made beehives in a location known as an apiary. The beehives made by people are usually the things referred to by the word "beehive."

Beehives have hexagonal cells in them, packed together. This is called a honeycomb.

Circe

In Greek mythology, Circe (; Greek Κίρκη "Kírkē" "falcon") is a minor goddess of magic. Sometimes, she is described as a nymph, witch, enchantress or sorceress. In the "Odyssey" Homer describes her as 'The loveliest of all immortals,' living on the island of , famous for her part in the adventures of Odysseus.

In most descriptions, Circe was the daughter of Helios, the god of the sun, and Perse, an Oceanid, and the sister of Aeetes, the keeper of the Golden Fleece, Perses, and Pasiphaë, the Wife of King Minos and mother of the Minotaur. Other accounts make her the daughter of Hecate.

Circe transformed her enemies, or those who offended her, into animals through the use of magical potions. She was known for her knowledge of drugs and herbs.

That Circe also purified the Argonauts for the death of Apsyrtus, as told in "Argonautica", may be an early tradition.

Raccoon Dog

The raccoon dog ("Nyctereutes procyonoides"), also known as the mangut, tanuki, or neoguri, is a member of the canid family and is from east Asia. Despite being hunted by many people (thousands of people), a small island in Japan has been designated a protected area for raccoon dogs.
Raccoon dogs are fox-like in build, but with shorter legs and tail. They have a dark patch on the side of the face, similar to a raccoon's facial markings.

Atsushi Yanagisawa

Yanagisawa was born in Imizu on May 27, 1977. After graduating from Toyama Daiichi High School, he joined J1 League club Kashima Antlers in 1996. He debuted in May 1996. In 1997, he became a regular player and was selected "Rookie of the Year award". In 1990s, the club won the champions at 1996, 1998 J1 League, 1997 J.League Cup and 1997 Emperor's Cup. In Asia, the club won the 3rd place at 1998–99 Asian Cup Winners' Cup. In 2000, the club won all three major title in Japan; J1 League, J.League Cup and Emperor's Cup. In 2001, the club won J1 League for 2 years in a row and he was selected "Japanese Footballer of the Year award". In 2002, the club won J.League Cup. In June 2003, Yanagisawa moved to Italian Serie A club Sampdoria. He moved to Messina Peloro in 2004.

In March 2006, Yanagisawa returned to Kashima Antlers. In 2007, the club won J1 League and Emperor's Cup. However his opportunity to play decreased behind young player Yuzo Tashiro and Shinzo Koroki. He moved to Kyoto Sanga FC in 2008. He scored 14 goals which is top score in Japanese player in the league. However he could not scored many goals from 2009. He moved to Vegalta Sendai in 2011. In March 2011, 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami occurred in wide area including Sendai. Although he did not play many matches, the club won the 4th place in 2011 and the 2nd place in 2012.

Tsuneyasu Miyamoto

Miyamoto was born in Tondabayashi on February 7, 1977. He joined J1 League club Gamba Osaka from their youth team in 1995. He became a regular player as center back from later 1990s.

Miyamoto played for Japan U-17 national team in the 1993 U-17 World Championship and Japan U-20 national team in the 1997 World Youth Championship. He played full-time in all matches in both tournaments. In September 2000, he was also selected the Japan U-23 national team for 2000 Summer Olympics.

On June 18, 2000, Miyamoto debuted for Japan national team against Bolivia.

Kenny Miller

Kenny Miller (born 23 December 1979) is a Scottish football player. He plays for the Scottish Premiership club Rangers and was a regular starter for the Scotland national team until his retirement from international football in 2013. He is a centre forward. He is one of only five players to ever play for both Rangers and Celtic, and one of only two to ever cross the divide twice.

Kenny started his career at Hibernian, and made his debut in the 1997/98 season. He was loaned to Stenhousemuir where he scored 10 goals in 11 games. He spent four years at the club, and was the Scottish Premier League top scorer in season 1999/00 and received the Scottish Young Player of the Year award in 2000.

Kenny signed for Rangers for £2 million in June 2000. He made his debut in a 4-1 win against FBK Kaunas on 26 July during a Champions League match. His first goal came on 5 August 2000 during an SPL match away to Kilmarnock, scoring the third in a 4-2 win.

Three months later, Miller netted five goals (a Scottish Premier League record) during a 7-1 home defeat of St. Mirren. More goals against Monaco and Aberdeen meant he had ten goals from just fourteen games. However, until the end of the season, Miller only scored once more, against Brechin City in the Scottish Cup.

In September 2001, he went to Wolverhampton Wanderers (Wolves) on a three-month loan, scoring two goals in his first two games. However, during his third match, Miller broke his shoulder in a fall. During the next two months, Wolves and Rangers had talks over his future. Wolves finally bought him on a permanent deal at a cost of £3 million. Miller had made a total of 38 appearances and scored 11 goals for Rangers.

In 2002/03 Miller was playing most games for Wolves, but he had only managed six goals in 19 games. However, during the final six months of the season he scored 18 goals in his final 24 appearances. He equalled a club record of scoring in six consecutive games. That helped Wolves gain promotion into the English Premier League.

In the summer of the 2005/06 season, the newly promoted Premiership team Sunderland wanted to sign Miller, but Wolves rejected their £1m and £1.2m offers and Miller began the new season as a Wolves player. Miller scored 12 goals, and ended the season as top scorer - the third time in Wolves last three seasons. Miller played more than 190 games for Wolves and scored more than 60 goals during his five years with the club.

When Miller's contract finished at the end of that season, he transferred to Celtic for free under special rules, called the Bosman ruling. He signed an agreement in January after refusing to sign a new deal at Wolves a month earlier. Miller became only the third player since the war to have played for both sides of the Old Firm - following Alfie Conn and Maurice Johnston.

Despite being praised by many for his overall performances, Miller failed to score in his first nine games for Celtic. He finally scored his first goal, against Old Firm rivals and former employers Rangers at Celtic Park in September 2006. He then went on to score in Celtic's 1–0 Champions League win against Copenhagen from the penalty spot and scored two in the 3–0 win over Benfica. By scoring in the 2006/07 Champions League season, Miller became the first player to score goals in the Champions League for both Rangers and Celtic. However, he ended the season with only four league goals. He did play in the 2007 Scottish Cup final, before being substituted because of an injury. Despite hints from the player himself that he would leave to get more first-team opportunities, Miller vowed to stay at the club and fight for his place at the club. Miller scored his first goal in his first appearance of the 2007/08 season in a 4–1 victory over Falkirk and added to his collection the following week by scoring against Aberdeen. He scored 11 goals in total for the club in 46 appearances.

Miller signed a three year deal with newly promoted English Premier League club Derby County on 31 August 2007 for an undisclosed fee, thought to be around £3 million, but later confirmed by Derby County manager Paul Jewell to be closer to £2.25m.

Miller started well at his new club, scoring in his first two home matches, including the winner on his league debut for the Rams against Newcastle United in a 1–0 win on 17 September 2007, a strike which won the club's Goal Of The Season award. However, following this initial success Miller netted just twice in his next 28 league fixtures.

With Derby looking like they would be relegated Miller said he would like to move just over 6 months after joining the club - with a return to Rangers his preferred destination, though his manager Jewell insisted any move would have to be financially fair for Derby.

A fee of £2m was agreed between Rangers and Derby allowing Miller to move back to Ibrox. The deal was completed on 13 June. Miller's return to Ibrox means he is one of only a few players to cross the Old Firm divide twice.

Miller made his second debut for the club on 30 July 2008 in a UEFA Champions League qualifier gainst FBK Kaunas. He scored in the first Old Firm game of the season on 31 August 2008. He followed this up with a further two goals against former employers Hibernian at Easter Road on 28 September 2008, then adding his sixth goal back in a Rangers shirt at Rugby Park in a 4-0 win over Kilmarnock.

Since making his Scotland national team debut in 2001, Miller has remained a player in the Scotland team under the management of Berti Vogts, Walter Smith and Alex McLeish.

He has scored goals in crucial games against several teams, including Germany and Ukraine. In 2005, Miller scored in three consecutive internationals, with goals against Austria, Italy and Norway.

Saltwater crocodile

The saltwater crocodile ("Crocodylus porosus") is the largest of all living reptiles. They are amphibious, living in sea water, rivers and on land. In terms of weight, it is the third largest amphibious animal, after the bull elephant seal (typically 2700 kg/6000 lb; 5 m/16 ft) and the walrus (typically 1400 kg/3000 lb; 3.6 m/12 ft)

Crocodiles are an ancient form of life, with fossils from 200 million years ago. 'Salties', as they are commonly called, are found in Northern Australia, New Guinea, some parts of Southeast Asia, and the surrounding waters. They live in habitats near the coast: rivers, swamps, billabongs, beaches and sometimes the open sea.

The saltwater crocodile is a large reptile growing to about in length. The males are bigger than the female, with some rare individuals as long as . Others believe in a slightly smaller size of . They can weigh up to . They have a powerful tail which helps with swimming. They have a wide snout, with big scales making two rows down their neck and back.

Saltwater crocodiles are now a protected species in Australia. However, if humans are at risk of being attacked, the crocodile is moved to avoid possible harm. Australia used to export crocodile skin. Between 1945 and 1958 more than 87,000 skins were exported. They became so scarce that hunters had difficulty finding any. They were protected in Western Australia in 1969, the Northern Territory in 1971, and Queensland in 1974. Hunting crocodiles is now illegal. There are now farms to breed crocodiles for the skins to make leather, meat and for Chinese medicines.

Saltwater crocodiles reproduce during the wet season, in Australia from November to March. There is a complex mating ritual which includes them rubbing their heads and bodies together, before they mate in the water. The female builds a nest with plants that she breaks off with her teeth, and then pushes together with her back legs. A female crocodile can lay up to 60 eggs at a time. These eggs are large, with a hard shell. They take about three months to hatch. If the temperature in the nest is less than 32 degrees Celsius, the baby crocodiles will be female. If the temperature is between 32 and 33 degrees the babies will be male. When the crocodiles hatch out of the eggs, the mother will carry them in her mouth to the water. Few of them survive in the wild and grow to be adult crocodiles.

Saltwater crocodiles can be dangerous (and very aggressive) to both humans and other animals. They can move very fast in the water and on land. Sometimes, they can kill a person, but this does not happen very often. Usually, there are "No Swimming" signs near areas with high crocodile activity. Crocodiles can lie very still for up to one hour. They are able to leap as high as . In March 1987, a Toyota land cruiser collided with a crocodile at Cahill's Crossing on the East Alligator River. The crocodile knocked the motor car off the roadway with its tail. Crocodiles can also live in fresh water. Scientists have found crocodiles up to 235 kilometres from the sea.

Saltwater crocodiles can go a long time without eating. When they do eat, they catch fish, crustaceans, birds or grazing animals that have come to the water to drink. The size of prey taken depends on how large the crocodile is.



Dildo, Newfoundland and Labrador

Dildo is a town on the southeastern Dildo Arm of Trinity Bay on the island of Newfoundland, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. It is about 100 kilometres west-northwest of St. John's. South Dildo is a neighbouring unincorporated community. It has been noted for its name, which is considered funny or strange due to being the same as the sex toy called a Dildo.

Dildo's history goes back to 2000 BC, when Maritime Archaic aboriginal people lived at Anderson's Cove. By 700 AD, the Dorset culture was on Dildo island. In 1613, the Beothuks, who were living on Dildo Island at this time. Henry Crout met them, traded with them, and left gifts. In 1711, the people of Trinity Bay were ordered by Governor Crow to leave their homes during the winter, to defend themselves against the French who burned their houses. Dildo Island was one of the places designated for this purpose. The town of Dildo was created in the late 1700s and settled to use the marine resources such as fish (mostly cod), whales and seals.

The first church was built in 1878. It was a simple structure with no tower. It was wide by long. It could hold 250 people. It was heated by two coal stoves, one at each end, which shared a chimney. This church served the community until 1964 when the present (larger) building was constructed.

Dildo has a fast-growing tourist industry. It has picturesque scenery, several bed and breakfasts, places to eat, the Dildo Museum interpretive centre, the Historic Dildo Days celebration in August, boat tours, the Society of United Fishermen, the Lions centre, several heritage structures, walking trails, many businesses and road sign souvenirs.

Dildo has been in many media outlets. It was on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's "On the Road Again" and "Land and Sea". It was also on a live radio broadcast from the interpretation centre. In August 2006, Dildo was the subject of the "What the...?" segment on the Australian television talk show "Rove Live". The town is mentioned in the song "A Night in Dildo" by The Arrogant Worms.

South Dildo is an unincorporated community. In 2008, 205 people lived there. At the beginning of the 20th century, South Dildo had lumbering work. It supplied a schooner to the Labrador fishery. It had the roadside attraction of a wooden life-size humpback whale head. (The whale head was destroyed at the beginning of the 2006-2007 winter.)

The red-crowned crane ("Grus japonensis"), also called the Japanese crane or Manchurian crane, is a large crane. It is the second rarest crane in the world after the North American whooping crane. In East Asia, it is known as a symbol of luck and fidelity. At 55 inches high, the crane does not make easy prey, for all that it stands out in its natural habitat of marshes and swamps. When it matures, the red-crowned crane is snow white with a patch of red skin on its head.

In the spring and summer, the red-crowned crane lives in Siberia, where their eggs hatch. Normally the crane lays two eggs, but usually only one chick survives. Later, in the autumn, it migrates in flocks to Korea, Japan, China, Taiwan, and other countries in East Asia to spend the winter. All red-crowned cranes migrate, except for a flock that stays in Hokkaido, year long. 

The crane eats small amphibians, aquatic invertebrates, insects, and plants that grow in marshes and swamps.

Natural gas vehicle

A natural gas vehicle or NGV is an alternative fuel vehicle that uses (compressed or liquefied) natural gas instead of other fossil fuels.

Natural gas is a mixture. It consists mainly of hydrocarbons. The main component is methane. Natural gas is often found in the ground together with petroleum.

The main difficulty in the use of natural gas is transportation. Natural gas pipelines are economical, but are impractical across oceans. Liquefied natural gas tankers are also used.

Compressed natural gas (CNG) is stored in containers at high pressure. 
Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is stored at temperatures as low as - 260 °F (- 162 °C). At these temperature conditions, natural gas is in a liquid state.

Étienne Lenoir built 1862 the first gas engine, before there have been fuel and diesel engines. Over the years gas was used in many different machines, so the technology improved also. From the 1950s the automobile industry focused more on fuel technology than on gas technology. There have only been single cars with natural gas technology and few gas stations which offered natural gas. Because of climate and environment the role of natural gas became more and more important.

Worldwide existing about 5.7 million natural gas vehicles.(Argentina, Brasilia and Pakistan together count 4.2 million!)

"Europe"

The French automobile producer Citroen is cooperating with a French gas supplier and wants to offer a compressor which is connected to the private gas connection at home, so that everyone can refuel his car at home.The price for the compressor will be about 500 €. There will be also a tax reduction for people who have bought a new NGV. And the business group carrefour wants to install natural gas stations.(Region Toulouse)

In London and surroundings, NGVs are free from paying the city toll. Owners of NGVs have to pay less motor vehicle tax.

Until 2011 MAN will deliver 135 busses with natural gas engines for the municipal use of the city Den Haag.

"Asia"

The Turkish capital Ankara will increase their use of natural gas vehicles about 500.

In India has already started a development programme to reduce pollution.

The number of NGVs increases very fast in Pakistan. Meanwhile there are driving about 1.4 million cars.

In Thailand, the government is planning a switch from fuel gas stations to natural gas stations, and to develop the NGVs.

"America"

In Brasilia, the police of Rio de Janeiro had 632 natural gas vehicles.

The use of NGV in the USA, makes it possible to maintain under the Ultra Low Emission Vehicle Standards(ULEV).

There are two variants of NG-technology, either the bifuel version, that means that the vehicle can drive with fuel or natural gas, or the monofuel version, this vehicle can only drive with natural gas. In principle the natural gas engine works like a otto-engine, the only significant difference is that this engine needs a natural gas-air-mix instead of fuel-air-mix.

A conversion is possible with each car(with a few exceptions).

The automobile industry will offer a new natural gas technology with turbo --> Turbo natural gas(TNG).


The advantages of natural gas are the lower price in comparison with fuel and the lower tax rate.

Since January 2008 there are 771 natural gas stations in Germany. The supply network will expand constantly.The E.ON Gas Mobil GmbH wants to install over 150 natural gas stations close to the freeways.

The natural gas technology was and is still very popular. Because of the current gas-conflict in Russia, natural gas became less popular. However, natural gas is a finite resource. The prices for gas will increase in the next years (like fuel), so there will be needed new technologies in the future.

Serial number

A serial number is a unique number used for identification. Serial numbers are made in such a way that they change by a fixed discrete integer value, each time a new serial number is needed. Most people refer to any identifier that has numbers and letters in it as a serial number and that can be used to pick a certain item of a large number of items. Not every numerical identifier is a serial number; identifying numbers which are not serial numbers are sometimes called .

Sequence numbers are almost always non-negative, and typically start at zero or one. 

Serial numbers can be very useful for quality control. That way, if there is a problem with a certain batch of products, the serial number of one defective item can tell which items are affected by the problem. Serial numbers can also be used against stealing or imitating products, because it is possible to keep track of which serial numbers have been used. Stolen goods or those with problems can be identified more easily.

Many computer programs come with serial numbers, often called "Compact Disc keys", and the installers often require the user to enter a valid serial number to continue. These numbers are verified using a certain algorithm to avoid usage of counterfeit keys. 

Serial numbers also help track down counterfeit currency, because in some countries each banknote has a unique serial number. 

The International Standard Serial Number or ISSN can be seen on magazines and other periodicals. It is the similar to the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) for books. It is serially assigned but takes its name from the library science use of serial to mean a periodical, like a newspaper.

Certificates and Certificate Authorities (CA) are necessary for widespread use of cryptography. These depend on applying mathematically rigorous serial numbers and serial number arithmetic 

The term "serial number" is also used in military formations as an alternative to the expression "service number". In air forces the serial number is used to identify a specific aircraft. It is usually painted on both sides of the aircraft, most often in the tail area, although in some cases the serial is painted on the side of the aircraft's fin/rudder(s). Because of this, the serial number is sometimes called a "tail number".

In the case of the UK Royal Air Force (RAF) the "Serial" takes the form of two letters followed by three numbers, e.g., "BT308"—the prototype Avro Lancaster, or "XS903"—an English Electric Lightning F.6 at one time based at RAF Binbrook . During the Second World War RAF aircraft carrying secret equipment or that were in themselves secret had "/G" added to the end of the serial, the "G" signifying "Guard", denoting that the aircraft was to have an armed guard at all times while on the ground, e.g., "LZ548/G"—the prototype de Havilland Vampire jet fighter, or "ML926/G"—a de Havilland Mosquito XVI experimentally fitted with H2S radar. Prior to this two-letter, three-number scheme, the RAF and preceding Royal Flying Corps (RFC) used a serial with a letter followed by four numbers, e.g., "D8096" - a Bristol F.2 Fighter currently owned by the Shuttleworth Collection, or "K5054" - the prototype Supermarine Spitfire. The aircraft serial number does not change.

Serial numbers are often used in network protocols. However, most sequence numbers in computer protocols are limited to a fixed number of bits, and will wrap around after a sufficiently many numbers have been allocated. Thus, recently-allocated serial numbers may duplicate very old serial numbers, but not other recently-allocated serial numbers. To avoid ambiguity with these non-unique numbers, , "Serial Number Arithmetic" defines special rules for calculations involving these kinds of serial numbers.

Lollipop sequence number spaces are a more recent and sophisticated scheme for dealing with finite-sized sequence numbers in protocols.

Giant huntsman spider

The giant huntsman spider (', from ', meaning “the largest”) is a spider of the "Heteropoda" genus. It is found in Laos, where it was discovered in 2001. The spider lives in caves.

In December 2008, a World Wide Fund for Nature report states that it is "the world's largest huntsman spider".

This spider is yellowish-brown with many dark spots on the rear half, in no order. The legs have wide dark bands before the first bend. Like all huntsman spiders, the legs of the giant huntsman spider are long compared to the body, and twist forward in a crab-like way.

It is the largest member of the Sparassidae, with a 30 centimeter (12 inches) leg-span, and 4.6 centimeter body-length. The largest known member of the Sparassidae known prior to the discovery of "H. maxima" was the Australian "Beregama aurea" (L. Koch, 1875) with a body length of about 4 centimeters.

Huntsman spider

Huntsman spider is a name given to the family Sparassidae (formerly "Heteropodidae"). They are also known as the giant crab spiders, due to the way they look. Larger ones, are also sometimes referred to as wood spiders, because they live in woody places (forest, mine shafts, woodpiles).

They are found in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Southeast Asia, the Mediterranean, Florida, and Hawaii, and possibly in many other tropical and semi-tropical regions. They can be found as far north as England, Sweden and Wales.

Huntsman spiders do not build webs, but hunt for food. They eat insects and other invertebrates.

The average huntsman spider is about 1 inch long with a leg span of up to 5 inches. The giant huntsman spider, however, has a leg span of up to 12 inches, making it the largest spider by diameter; it is often described as being "the size of a dinner plate."

Brown huntsman spider

The brown huntsman spider ("Heteropoda venatoria"), also known as the giant crab spider or the cane spider, is a species of spider. found in many tropical and subtropical parts of the world, including Asia, Réunion Island, the Caribbean islands, the Southeastern US, and (especially) Australia.

They have a flat type of body and only a small dorsal pattern. Adults can grow to be 2.2 to 2.8 cm, and have a leg span of 7 to 12 cm. Some have colors of brown, white and black.

Females have a larger abdomen than males but males have longer and thinner legs with a slim body. Both have a wide, yellow to cream clypeus band around the rest of the carapace. The female also has a strong body and often carries a pillow-like egg sac under her.

Brown huntsman spiders do not use spider webs to feed on prey. These spiders are known to hunt by waiting and making no noise above their prey, and then rush forward when their prey get close. They are fast, agile and can move through tight spaces. They feed at night.

If you let them into your home, they will eat unwanted bugs and insects like cockroaches and silverfish.

Dorsal

In anatomy, the dorsal is the upper side of animals that can run, fly, or swim in a forwards and backwards direction, and the back side of animals (like humans) that walk upright. In vertebrates the dorsum contains the backbone. The term dorsal means the parts that are either located toward or grow off that side of an animal. The opposite side of the animal is described with the terms ventrum and ventral.

In humans, the top of the foot is the dorsal part.

Examples of the use of "dorsal" are the dorsal fins of fish. 

Clypeus

The clypeus is one of the hard parts that makes up the face of an insect. The clypeus is often well-defined by grooves along its horizontal and vertical margins, and is most commonly rectangular in overall shape.

Carapace

A carapace is the top part of an exoskeleton or shell in a number of animal groups.

Sapindaceae

Sapindaceae, also known as the soapberry family, is a family of flowering plant including maple, horse chestnut, longan, and lychee. In the APG II system (2003) the family includes the plants otherwise assigned to families Aceraceae and Hippocastanaceae and is placed in order Sapindales.

Leônidas

Leônidas da Silva (6 September 1913 – 24 January 2004) was a Brazilian football player. He played for Brazil national team. Leônidas was famous for his bicycle kicks and possessed good dribbling and pace. His nickname was the "Rubber Man" and "Black Diamond" because of his incredible agility. He is regarded as one of the most important football players in the first half of the 20th century and he is considered one of the greatest strikers of 1930s and 1940s.

Born in São Cristóvão on September 6, 1913, he was the son of Manoel Nunes da Silva and Maria da Silva. He was a simple boy from São Cristóvão, a neighborhood in the residential and commercial area of ​​Rio de Janeiro, where his mother lived in the house of his adoptive parents, a fan of Fluminense ,delighted that he was with the three-time champion carioca team from 1917-18 and 1918-19. Although he completed his primary studies and high school in schools in that neighborhood, Leônidas wanted to dedicate himself to football. At a very young age, he began to practice the sport, then an amateur in Brazil, in the nudes at Ponte dos Marinheiros. At the age of 13, he stood out as a juvenile of São Cristóvão. In 1926, he also started to defend other clubs in the neighborhood, such as Havanesa, then Barroso and Sul-Americano, in order to earn some money.

In 1929, he played for Syrio and Libanez. In 1931, Leônidas moved to Bonsucesso, where he began his semi-professionalization by signing his first contract, for which he would receive four hundred thousand réis per month. At Bonsucesso, Leônidas also played basketball, having won the championship in this sport. A year later, he was already featured in Carioca football, having been called up to play in the Carioca National Team in a friendly against Ferencváros TC, then Hungarian champion, and scored a goal in the match. Also in 1931, he won the Brazilian State Team Championship. Still in 1934, he transferred to Peñarol, where he could not shine because of a knee injury. He returned to Rio de Janeiro to play for Vasco da Gama, who played one season and helped the club win the 1934 Campeonato Carioca. The following year, he changed clubs again, going to play for Botafogo, where he won Carioca that season. In 1936, he transferred to Flamengo, where he played until 1942, becoming Rio champion in 1939. This transfer would be remembered by Botafogo leader Carlito Rocha, more than thirty years later: "Leônidas gave an interview in Rio Grande do Sul, stating that he was Flamengo at heart. When he returned, he confirmed the statements. I sent him away immediately and fixed the price of the pass at five contos [de réis], which was how much he owed the club's treasury. The next day, Flávio Costawent to the club and took Leonidas to Flamengo. I couldn't admit to Botafogo an athlete who publicly said that under his white shirt, a red-black heart beat. The mood in Flamengo was deteriorating, however. In early 1941, he refused to participate in a tour of Argentina due to an injury, in addition to his constant participation in advertisements, which led to problems with the directors. In the midst of this, he was arrested by the Army for using a false reservist certificate to get a public job, ending his time at Flamengo. In 1943, Leônidas moved to São Paulo. Its debut broke the attendance record at the Pacaembu stadium, with more than seventy thousand fans in attendance. He was recognised one of the biggest idols in the club's history, having been Champion Paulistain 1943, 1945, 1946, 1948 and 1949. The following year, the Rubber Man retired from football at the age of 37.

Taking advantage of an injury to the famous striker Nilo, Leônidas won an opportunity in the Brazilian National Team on December 4, 1932, which would face Uruguay at Estádio Centenário, for the Copa Rio Branco. Brazil won with two goals from young Leônidas da Silva. In 1934, he was one of those called up for the World Cup in Italy, having scored the only goal of the Brazilian team's only match in the competition. He was left out for Copa América in 1937, Still at the end of the 1930s, Leônidas was the biggest highlight of the Brazilian team in the 1938 World Cup, having been the top scorer in the competition, with eight goals. Brazil achieved its best participation in World Cups so far, taking third place. Subsequently, the Black Diamond was chosen the best player of that Cup. He participated during the Roca Cup when Brazil finished second against Argentina and also in 1940. He played in the Copa Rio Branco in 1940 and Brazil finished as runners-up against Uruguay. He was close to participate for Copa América in 1942 and 1945 but he wasn't able to be selected. He won the Roca Cup with Brazil against Argentina, Leonidas was selected to play for Copa América in 1946, It was the first and only time that he played for the Copa América, where Brazil finished second.

After leaving the lawns in 1951, he was still connected to the sport. He was manager of São Paulo, soon after became a sports commentator, being considered by many a direct, tough and controversial commentator. He went on to win seven Roquette Pinto Trophies. He had a cameo in the Brazilian film Susana e o Presidente, from 1951. His broadcasting career had to be cut short in 1974 due to Alzheimer's Disease. For thirty years he lived in a home for the elderly in São Paulo until he died on January 24, 2004 at the age of 90, due to complications related to the disease. He was buried at Cemitério da Paz in São Paulo.

Ademir de Menezes

Ademir Marques de Menezes (8 November 1922 – 11 May 1996) was a Brazilian football player. He played for Brazil national team. Regarded as one of the best strikers in the world. A fast and powerful striker, with a strong shot in both feet, Ademir began his career as a left winger before moving to the centre, causing havoc in opposing defences with his skill and sublime finishing. People at the time considered him an unequalled ball juggler who knew every trick in the book. He used to wreak havoc among defences with his quick changes in tempo, fooling his opponents with deceptions carried out almost at lightning speed, his mastering of the ball in all situations and the ability to accelerate rapidly. His prominent underbite earned him the nickname "Queixada", which means "jaw".

He came to football at the age of 14 in 1937. He first played at the youth level in the Pernambuco state championship for the Sport Recife team, where his father Antonio Rodriguez, a retired colonel, was on the board of directors. With the team in 1939, 1940 and 1941 Ademir became the champion of the competition. Among other players, the young mulatto stood out with excellent starting speed and "jet" breakthroughs with the ball, which the Brazilians called the English word "rush". Together with the Pernambuco team, in 1942 Ademir went on tour in Brazil. During the trip, the team met in matches with the strongest clubs in the country. And to the surprise of the organizers of friendly matches, in 16 games the national team won 10 victories. The match with Vasco da Gama turned out to be the most enchanting. At the beginning of the game, the Pernambuco team lost 0-3, but thanks to four goals Ademir was able to win with a score of 5-4. After the match, the owners of the defeated club could not be surprised by the skill of the striker and the same 1942 Ademir moved to "Vasco da Gama". He then became the first Brazilian footballer to receive money for a new team. He played for Vasco for three years, during which time he added another state title to his title, but now not to Pernambuco, but to Rio. The team won this title at the peak of its popularity in 1945. Vasco did not lose a single match in that championship. In 1946 , Ademir moved to another club from Rio de Janeiro, Flamengo, for two years. And together with him he became the champion of the state of Rio. At that time, the striker was a real leader of his team, which beat thanks to his goals of both its main competitors - and "Vasco da Gama" and "Botafogo". And in 1948, Ademir returned to Vasco da Gama and played here until 1956 , the end of his professional football career (next year he will play several matches in his first team - Sport Recife) - but only in the role of the amateur). As part of the team, he became the South American club champion in 1948, won the Rio State Championship three more times, and in 1949 and 1950 became the top scorer in the state championship. He had 30 and 25 goals, respectively.

Ademir has played for the national team for the first time in 1945. On January 21, he first appeared in a match against Colombia. He started playing as a left forward, and later the coach began to use him as a central striker. In 1949, together with the national team, Ademir became the champion of South America. He was considered such a dangerous player in those days that rival teams were forced to use a separate central defender to neutralize him. The striker gained his greatest fame at the 1950 World Cup, becoming the tournament's top scorer. However, he could thank his fellow defenders, who gave great passes. The attacker had only to lock them. But over the goal in the game with the Spaniards Ademir really "sweated". In the fight with defender Parra, he gained control of the ball and suddenly hit the goal. Goalkeeper Ramallets tried to save his team, but could not even touch the leather ball. Despite the victories, in the main, final match, the Brazilians lost to Uruguay 2-1. The defeat was a great grief for the succession of the whole country. But the celebration of Ademir's golden boot still became a spoonful of honey in a barrel of tar. The player was noted for his ability to use his moments, and his compatriot Didi compared Ademir to the Frenchman Just Fontaine. Didi said of both strikers that "they are the ones who score nine of the ten goal moments." 
Ademir's greatest popularity in Brazil came in the late 1940s and early 1950s. It was so large that Brazilians named their newborns after him. The son of Brazilian defender Domingos da Guia also grew up with this name. In 1974, Ademir da Guia participated in the World Cup.
It is known that during the 1950 World Cup, a man ran to the coach of the Brazilian national team, Flavio Costa, and began to ask him to release Ademir from the Casadas-Pedras camp for a few hours. The man explained that his son urgently needed surgery. And he does not want to agree to it until he sees Ademir. Flavio Costa made an exception and released his striker from the Brazilian camp to meet a stubborn little fan. Obviously, the meeting played a positive role and the operation was quite successful. Ademir was also preparing to participate in the 1954 World Cup. But an injury prevented him from playing. After that, the player decided to finish playing for the national team. His last match was against Uruguay on March 15, 1953.

In 1957, Ademir returned to the amateur club "Sport Recife", where he began his career. He played a few games here, but due to poor form he was forced to stop playing altogether. Until 1967, Ademir tried his hand at coaching, working at the Vasco da Gama club, but later began working in journalism. The former footballer contributed to the newspapers of Rio de Janeiro, and also worked as a football commentator for Radio Maua. Ademir died on May 11, 1996 at the age of 73.

Caesar salad

A Caesar salad is a salad that is made with romaine lettuce and croutons dressed with parmesan cheese, lemon juice, olive oil, egg, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and black pepper. Some of the most common variations to the salad include: grilled poultry (most often chicken), meat, shellfish, or fish, capers, Romano cheese, anchovies, and bacon.

Caesar dressing can be either creamy, like Ranch dressing, or more oily, like Italian dressing. Its main flavourings are garlic and anchovies.

The salad is said to have been made and called after Caesar Cardini, an Italian immigrant who had restaurants in Mexico and the United States. Cardini was living in San Diego but also working in Tijuana.

The original Caesar salad did not have anchovy. Cardini's daughter said that the original recipe included whole lettuce leaves. 

There are risks of infection by salmonella bacteria. Salmonella is sometimes in raw eggs. This is a concern with many similar dressings. They are emulsified with eggs. Later versions of the recipe call for briefly cooked coddled eggs or pasteurized eggs. There are many variations of this salad.

Blacklist (computing)

In computing, blacklisting is a form of access control. A proxy server might check the list of pages accessed against a "blacklist", if the address is on the blacklist, the page cannot be accessed.
Blacklists are used to protect a variety of systems in computing. The content of the blacklist has to be targeted to the type of system defended.

An information system includes hosts like computers and servers. A blacklist in this location may include certain types of software that aren't allowed to run in the company environment. For example, a company might blacklist worker to worker file sharing on its systems, to stop them editing worker information. In addition to software, people, devices and websites can also be blacklisted.

Most email providers have an anti-spam feature that essentially blacklists certain email addresses if they are thought to be spam or malicious. For example, a user who gets of a lot of emails from a particular address, they may blacklist that address, and the email client will automatically route all messages from that address to a junk-mail folder or delete them without telling the user.

An e-mail spam filter may keep a blacklist of email addresses, any mail from which would be prevented from reaching its intended destination. It may also use sending domain names or sending IP addresses to implement a more general block.

In addition to private email blacklists, there are lists that are kept for public use, including:

The goal of a blacklist in a web browser is to prevent the user from visiting a malicious or deceitful web page via filtering. A common web browsing blacklist is Google's Safe Browsing, which is installed by default in Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.

Blacklisting can also apply to user information. It is usual for systems or websites to blacklist certain usernames that aren't allowed to be chosen by the system or website's users. These reserved usernames are commonly associated with built-in system administration functions. Also usually blocked by default are profane words and racial slurs, for example, ROBLOX has a feature blocking certain usernames from being used.

Password blacklists are very similar to username blacklists but contain more entries than username blacklists. Password blacklists are used to stop users from choosing passwords that are easily guessed or are well known and could lead to unauthorized access by malicious parties. Password blacklists are used as a layer of security, which sets the requirements of the password length and/or character complexity. This is because there are a lot of number password combinations that fulfill many password policies but are still easily guessed (i.e., Password123, Qwerty123).

Changing room

A changing room or changeroom (American English) or change room or locker-room is a special room people use to change clothes. It is either for one person only, or it is separated by sex, that is there is one for men, and another one for women. At swimming pools and gymnasiums, showers or shower stalls (closets) are often in a changing room or there is a shower room nearby. Beach-style changing rooms are often large open rooms with benches against the walls. At beaches, some changing rooms do not have a roof. Stores that sell clothes often have changing rooms for one person to try on clothes. At stores, often there is a mirror. Some workplaces have changing rooms. Some cosplay events have changing rooms. 

For live theater, opera, or on television and film sets, rooms for the actors to change costumes and put on makeup are usually called dressing rooms. 

Abraxas grossulariata

Abraxas grossulariata is a moth of the family Geometridae. It lives in Europe and North America. Its speckled color patterns have given it the common name magpie moth. The caterpillar is about the same in color as the adult and feeds on the leaves of shrubs such as gooseberry.

Bookworm (insect)

Bookworm is a term for any kind of insect which supposedly chews through books.

This behaviour is uncommon. Both the larvae of the deathwatch beatle ("Xestobium rufovillosum") and the common furniture beetle ("Anobium punctatum") will go through wood and if paper is nearby they will pass into that.

A major book-feeding insect is the booklouse (or book louse). It is a tiny (under 1 mm), soft-bodied wingless "psocoptera" (usually "Trogium pulsatorium"). The insect actually eats molds and other plants found in books that were not kept clean and safe, but they will also attack bindings and other parts. It is also not a true louse.

Many other insects, like the silverfish ("Lepisma saccharina") or cockroach (various "Blattodea"), will eat these molds, including rotten paper or the starch-based binding pastes – warmth and moisture or high humidity are needed, so damage is more common in the tropics. Modern glues and paper are less attractive to insects.

By the twentieth century, modern bookbinding materials prevented much of the damage done to books by book-boring insects.

County (United States)

A county, in the United States, is a political subdivision and form of government that is right below the state. 48 out of the 50 states in the United States use counties. Louisiana calls its counties "parishes" while Alaska got rid of counties and only uses boroughs. Both of these are equal to the county. The list that the U.S. Census Bureau keeps that lists all of the counties in the United States says that there are 3,481 counties or other kinds of divisions that are equal to the county in the United States.

The mid-western and northeastern states in the United States divide the county further into townships or towns, some of which have municipalities. The place where the county government and courts are is called the "county seat". 

On average, a county in the United States has a population of around 100,000 people. The county that has the most people living in it is Los Angeles County, California, where over 10 million people live. The county that has the fewest people living in it is Loving County, Texas, where as of the 2020 United States Census, 64 people live. 

The average number of counties in each state is 62. Louisiana has the fewest counties with none. It is divided into parishes instead of counties. In states with counties, Delaware has the fewest with only 3. Texas has the most counties with 254. 

These pages list all of the counties in each state:

Approval

Approval could mean:


Save (ice hockey)

In ice hockey, a goaltender is credited with a save when they prevent a shot from entering the net. A goaltender's efficiency (how good he is at doing it) in stopping shots is calculated as a percentage of shots stopped divided by shots aimed at them.

Shutout

In team sports, a shutout (a clean sheet in association football) means that one team in a game prevented the other from scoring. They often happen in ice hockey and association foot, sometimes in baseball and American football, rarely in rugby, and although it is possible, it almost never occurs in basketball.

In association football, it is commonly known as a clean sheet.

Goals against average

Goals against average (often shortened to GAA) is a statistic used in ice hockey, water polo, lacrosse, and association football that is the mean of goals allowed per game by a goaltender.

Time Protocol

The TIME service is an Internet protocol defined in . Its purpose is to provide a site-independent, machine readable date and time.

TIME can operate over either TCP or UDP. When operating over TCP, a host connects to a server that supports the TIME protocol on TCP port 37. The server then sends the time as a 32-bit unsigned binary number in network byte order representing a number of seconds since 00:00 (midnight) 1 January, 1900 GMT and closes the connection. The host receives the time and closes the connection.

When operating over UDP, the client sends a (usually empty) datagram to UDP port 37. The server responds with a single datagram of length 4 containing the time. There is no connection setup or teardown.

Tropical Depression Sixteen (2008)

Tropical Depression Sixteen was the sixteenth, and weakest, tropical cyclone of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. Sixteen formed from a strong tropical disturbance off the eastern shores of Nicaragua on October 13. The disturbance quickly turned into a tropical depression the next day while being very close to the coastline. Because of its close distance towards land, the depression was not able to form strong convection, which was the reason why it did not become stronger. Once off the northern shores of Honduras, the depression became disorganized, but was able to strengthen a little bit, reaching its peak intensity with winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) on the afternoon of October 15. The depression then moved onshore and quickly died out by the next morning.

A lot of rainfall from the depression started deadly flooding in Central America which left at least 75 people dead and forcing 100,000 people to move, and being responsible for $150 million in damage.

On the afternoon of October 13, a large area of low pressure formed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea, about 160 mi (160 km) east-southeast of Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua. The low was found in a place that was good for development and a tropical cyclone formation alert was given out soon after the low formed. The low slowly became better organized and was thought to have turned into a tropical depression the next morning while it was 50 mi (80 km) northeast of the Nicaragua/Honduras border. The depression was predicted to move across from the coastline, and later move to the west when it was north of Honduras, and by then make landfall in Belize as a tropical storm with winds of 65 mph (105 km/h) on October 18.

But the convection that was associated with the depression went away and the whole structure of the storm started to get worse. The depression stayed disorganized during the morning, in spite of curved banding traits forming, they stayed far from the center of circulation. In the late afternoon, the depression mooved onto the northern coastline of Honduras with winds still at 30 mph (45 km/h). Even though being over land and still being disorganized, the depression became a little bit more strong enough to reach its peak intensity of 35 mph (55 km/h) on the afternoon of October 15. This happened because of a mistake of a QuikSCAT satellite pass a ship, with the code H3VR, reporting 38 mph (61 km/h) sustained winds, and a buoy report. However, the winds were actually though to have been weaker than what was said because of the ridge of high pressure that was over the southern United States. The final advisory on the depression was given out the next morning as it turned back into a remnant low.

The National Hurricane Center gave out a lot of tropical storm watches while the storm was still alive, while in Costa Rica a red alert warning was put into effect across much of the country, and more than 100,000 people were told to move to safer places. Because the depression never became a tropical storm, tropical storm-conditions were not felt in the watch areas.

Heavy rains from the depression's remnant low left at least 16 people dead and six missing and forced 100,000 other people from their homes across Central America. The depression destroyed bridges, flooded villages and blocked roads. Total damage is thought to be at about $150 million (2008 USD).



High pressure area

A high pressure area (also called a high or high-pressure) is an area where the atmospheric pressure is greater than the rest of the atmosphere.


Tropical cyclone formation alert

A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) is a notice given out by the U.S. Navy-run Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Honolulu, Hawaii or the Naval Maritime Forecast Center in Norfolk, Virginia warning of the possibility of a tropical cyclone forming from a tropical disturbance that has been watched carefully.


90377 Sedna

90377 Sedna (or simply Sedna; symbol ) is a trans-Neptunian object which is the farthest dwarf planet from the Sun. It was discovered on November 14, 2003 by Mike Brown, Chad Trujillo and David Rabinowitz. Around 1250-1800 km in diameter, Sedna takes roughly 11,400 years to orbit the Sun, much higher than most known trans-Neptunian objects. It is one of the most distant known objects in the Solar System. Therefore, Sedna's surface temperature never rises above -240°C. 

The name "Sedna" comes from the Inuit goddess of the sea, thought to live at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean.

NASA is not currently planning any space missions to explore Sedna, but there is some talk of missions to happen when Sedna reaches perihelion again in 2076. It is considered to be a likely candidate as a dwarf planet.

No pictures can be taken of Sedna because very little light from the Sun reaches it. For this reason, Sedna is known as "Cobian", meaning shadows in Ancient Greek. Due to its orbit, the chances of Sedna being found were 0.017%. 40-120 more objects this size should exist without us knowing, but, as they are so small and far away, they may not be discovered for a while.

Boa constrictor

Boa constrictor is a non-venomous Boa species. The snake is found in Central and South America, and on some islands in the Caribbean. The common name is the same as the scientific name, which is unusual. The color pattern of its skin can vary considerably. Boa constrictors grow to a large size. There are ten subspecies."

The size adult animals reach varies among subspecies. The largest animals have been found in Northern south America. Two animals from Suriname are currently the largest on record: One reached 411cm (13.5 ft), the other 427cm (a bit over 14 ft). Such sizes are rare, boas reaching 3m are considered large. There is a report of a boa reaching 5.6m in Trinidad, but it is believed that snake was an anaconda,"Eunectes murinus", taken for a boa.

Boas can use their tail to grasp things. Boas do not have organs that react to warmth around the mouth.

Boas have a color pattern that is brownish, and becomes brick red around the tail. Dorsally, the ground color is overlaid with a series of large tan-colored saddles that become lighter towards the tail. Here, the saddles break up into half rings of a pale cream color in vivid contrast with the red.

All boids are constrictors, that is, they kill by squeezing their prey to suffocation. This species is a rare instance of an animal having the same common and scientific binomial name.

All subspecies are referred to as "boa constrictors". 
"B. c. constrictor" is also called the "common boa."

Other common names include "jibóia" (Brazil) and "macajuel" (Trinidadian, pronounced "mah-cah-well").

Found from northern Mexico through Central America (Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama) to South America north of 35°S (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Brazil, Bolivia, Uruguay and Argentina. Also in the Lesser Antilles (Dominica and St. Lucia), on San Andrés, Providencia and many other islands along the coasts of Mexico and Central and South America.

Flourishes in a wide variety of environmental conditions, from tropical rainforests to arid country.

Small individuals may climb into trees and shrubs to forage, but they become mostly terrestrial as they become older and heavier. It is said that specimens from Central America are more irascible, hissing loudly and striking repeatedly when disturbed, while those from South America tame down more readily.

Prey includes a wide variety of mammals and birds. Their diet mostly consists of rodents, but larger lizards and mammals as big as ocelots are also reported to have been consumed.

Ovoviviparous, females give birth to live young that average 15-20 inches (38–51 cm) in length.

This species does well in captivity, usually becoming quite tame. It is a common sight in zoos. Captive longevity is 20 to 30 years, with rare accounts of over 40 years, making them a long-term commitment as a pet. Proper animal husbandry is the most significant factor in captive lifespan. Though still exported from their native South America in significant numbers, it is widely bred in captivity.

Garrincha

Manuel dos Santos (28 October 1933 – 20 January 1983) was a Brazilian football player. He played for the Brazil national team. Garrincha, the nickname, "little bird", he got from his sister. He won the 1962 World Cup in Chile with Brazil after Pelé was injured. He is regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time and considered one of the best dribblers and by many the greatest dribbler ever. 

Garrincha's best talent consisted in his very particular dribbling, a game that he performed in making two different types of movements: cutting towards the inside of the field or, typically, widening to the right, always starting with the ball placed near the sideline of the pitch. Garrincha, after receiving the ball on the wing, aimed at the direct opponent and then stopped, causing the marker to stop in turn, after which he threw himself to the right, subsequently folding on the opposite side. He repeated the play more than once, when he decided to overtake the now disoriented defender with a definitive acceleration again on the right. Dribbling was made particularly effective by the explosiveness of the shot and the unpredictability of the movements due to the asymmetry of the lower limbs. Garrincha often abused this skill, as he used to dribble opponents and wait for them to retrace their steps so as to overcome them a second time, for pure pleasure; in a match for the Rio-San Paolo tournament that Botafogo played against América, the referee threatened to expel him due to the excessive number of dribbles carried out at the expense of full-back Ivan.

Despite having been afflicted with several birth defects (he had strabismus, an imbalance of the pelvis, six centimeters of length difference between the legs; the right knee had valgus and the left varus), Garrincha, "The Anjo de Pernas Tortas", was one of the main players in the 1958 FIFA World Cup and the 1962 FIFA World Cup, when, after Pelé's injury, he became the main player of the Brazilian team. Of Brazil's 14 goals in the competition, six (42%) went through his feet (he scored four and provided two assists for goals). In this tournament, he became the first player to win the Golden Ball (best player in the tournament), the Golden Boot (the competition's top scorer) and the World Cup trophy. Because of this, the 1962 World Cup is known in Brazil as "The Garrincha Cup". 

Included in the World Team of the 20th Century by 250 of the world's most respected football writers and journalists, he was selected in 1994 for the FIFA World Cup All-Time Team and ranked seventh in a vote among FIFA experts. about the best player of the 20th century.

Garrincha was born in 1933 in Pau Grande, a small town near Rio de Janeiro. At birth, it was found that his left leg was turned outwards and that his right leg was six centimeters shorter and turned inwards. Despite, or perhaps because of this handicap, Garrincha went on to become a highly technical footballer and one of the greatest dribblers of all time. Garrincha was a great footballer, but in his private life he had a lot of problems. He was a heavy drinker and was involved in a car accident several times. In 1969, his mother-in-law was killed in one of these accidents.

Garrincha married twice. The first time with Nair Marques, a factory girl from his hometown of Pau Grande, and the second time with Elza Soares, a well-known samba singer. But in addition, Garrincha had several other affairs and in total he left behind thirteen children after his death, one of which was in Sweden. In the spring of 1959, Garrincha had an affair with a waitress from the players' hotel in Umeå, after a Botafogo friendly match in Sweden. Nine months later, a letter was delivered to him in Rio de Janeiro saying that Garrincha had fathered a son. His Swedish grandson, Martin Lindberg, also had an aptitude for football and played as a right winger as a youth player for Halmstads BK, but had to finish football at level after he tore his knee ligament in 2009.

After his football career, things quickly went downhill for Garrincha. He didn't know how to handle the fame and started drinking more and more. In 1983, at the age of 49, he died of cirrhosis. His funeral procession, from Maracanã Stadium to Pau Grande, drew thousands of people and after his death people wrote on the wall: "Thank you, Garrincha, for living".

In the capital Brasilia, a stadium is named after him: Estádio Mané Garrincha, and the stadium of Esporte Clube Pau Grande also bears his name.

Garrincha played in his youth for a local club from Pau Grande. At the age of nineteen, in the summer of 1953, he reported for the first time for a trial training, at Botafogo in Rio de Janeiro. He played as a right winger against international Nílton Santos (later elected by FIFA as left back in the twentieth century world team). Garrincha passed him immediately. Nilton Santos thought he could tame this young lad, but Garrincha also left him behind for the next five moves. The trainer had seen enough and after three training sessions, Garrincha was allowed to try in the first team of Botafogo and immediately scored a hat trick.

He played for the club for twelve years and scored 232 times in 581 matches. With Botafogo he won the Campeonato Brasileiro once and the Campeonato Carioca three times. In his last years at this club, Garrincha's body started to work against him and his broken knees started to hinder him more and more. After his stint with Botafogo, he played a number of matches for Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, Flamengo and Colombian Atlético Junior. In 1969 there was talk of him being sold to the French Red Star Paris, but he never signed a contract. In 1972 he finished his career with Olaria.

On tour through Europe, with Botafogo, he played in the Netherlands in 1959 against Willem II (win), Fortuna '54 (win) and Feyenoord (loss).

Between 1955 and 1966, Garrincha played 50 games for the Brazil national team with 12 goals and played in the 1958 World Cup, 1962 World Cup and 1966 World Cup. Brazil became world champions in 1958 and 1962. He also won the Oswaldo Cruz Cup five times in 1955, 1956 but he didn't play any matches, 1958, 1961 and 1962. He became champions in 3 O'Higgins Cup tournaments in 1955, 1959 and 1961. He also won the Roca Cup in 1957, 1960 and 1963 but he wasn't able to play any matches in that year's tournament. And he also won the Taça Atlântico Cup in 1956 but he couldn't play any matches and he won the 1960 tournament. Garrincha was omitted to play for the 1954 FIFA World Cup and 1956 South American Championship.

This was the first World Cup for both Pelé and Garrincha. In the first two games, Garrincha and Pelé were stubbornly ignored by Feola. After a collective plea from the selection, they were finally included in the base against the Soviet Union. In that match, Garrincha tried the left post and Pelé the right within two minutes. Garrincha turned right back Kuznetsov completely mad and already in the third minute Vavá. scored the 1-0. The Soviet Union was not given a moment's rest by Brazil. Yet it only became 2-0 thirteen minutes before the end, again with Vavá as the finisher. The spectators in Gothenburg still marveled at a comical bouncer by Garrincha. As if on a string, he had as many as five Russians dance in a circle around the ball. Brazil's demonstration justified a much higher score than the 2-0. But the world had become acquainted with the Pelé and Garrincha phenomena. Brazil eventually reached the final, in which they beat Sweden by no less than 5-2. He was being recognized as one of the best players of the tournament and was included in the Team of the tournament. Garrincha won the first world title.

Four years later, Garrincha shone at the World Cup in Chile, where Pelé was injured in the second game. It would be Garrincha's tournament. The Brazilians, with largely the same team as in 1958, missed the brilliance of four years before. Garrincha led them to a second world title. In the quarter-final against England, he stepped out of the shadow of the absent Pelé in full glory for the first time. He could even head straight away. At the 1-0 he reached, 1.68 meters short, higher than the 1.86 meters long Maurice Norman. After the 1-1, Garrincha inspired the Brazilians as pacesetter. He awarded Vavá the 2-1 and closed the show himself with 3-1. In the semi-finals, home country Chile was then defeated 4-2, partly thanks to Garrincha's 1-0 and 2-0. In the final phase, Garrincha was kicked in the shins for the umpteenth time. The star was so tired of the pounding that he kicked back. The expelled Garrincha fled to the locker room to cheers and whistles. On the way another bottle popped on his head. Bleeding, he made it to the catacombs. He was allowed to be used in the final against Czechoslovakia. After the intervention of the Brazilian Prime Minister Tancredo Neves, his suspension was converted to an official warning. Garrincha played the final with a fever of 39 degrees, so he had to leave the leading role to others. After trailing 1-0, the Czechs, with Josef Masopust as director, were defeated 3-1. Garrincha became this tournament's top scorer and player of the tournament.

The 1966 tournament in England was not a great experience for Brazil. Garrincha had long ceased to be the star of four years earlier, but no one dared to keep him out of the squad. The first match at the World Cup was won, but the second, against Hungary, was lost. It was Garrincha's fifteenth and final game for the Brazilian national team. It was the first time that the Brazilian team lost with Garrincha in the squad.

Garrincha said goodbye to football on December 19, 1973 at the age of 40, when a friendly match between the Brazilian national team and a selection of players chosen by FIFA, called FIFA XI, took place at the Maracanã stadium. In addition to Garrincha, the first team was made up of players who had won the World Cup three years earlier, including Carlos Alberto Torres, Brito, Rivelino, Jairzinho and Pelé; the second was made up of ten elevenths by Argentines and Uruguayans. The match ended 2-1 for the Brazilian selection, thanks to goals from Pelé - who dribbled all the opposing defense - and Luís Pereira. The proceeds were donated to Garrincha himself, who at the end of the match, during which he did not shine, moved on a field tour to say goodbye to the one hundred and thirty-one thousand spectators who came to the stadium.

Garrincha still played for more than ten years at an amateur level. Among the teams with which he played in this period it is worth mentioning that of the Milionários, a formation made up of ex-professionals who used to play friendly matches around Brazil. With this team he played almost five hundred games between 1974 and 1982, alongside famous names such as Nílton Santos, Hilderaldo Bellini, Djalma Santos, Vavá, Rivelino and Serginho.

He also played in the Sacrofano football team, being paid 100,000 lire per game, then a militant in the First Category championship and coached by Dino da Costa, his former teammate in Botafogo, dragging her to victory in the Mignano Monte Lungo quadrangular tournament. His last appearance on a football field was at a charity match held on Christmas day 1982, during which he played for twenty minutes (forty-five according to other sources). The match was held at Planaltina, near Brasilia against Londrina, with Garrincha, and the representative of the Associaçao de Garancia ao Atleta Profissional (AGAP), a team that won 1-0.

Garrincha died on January 20, 1983, at the age of 49 from the consequences of liver cirrhosis and pulmonary edema in conditions of poverty and degradation. and was buried in the Raiz da Serra cemetery in Rio de Janeiro.

His nickname was "Peito de Aço" (Steel Chest). He was known for his goalscoring ability, dribbling, vision, beating opponents and having explosive shots. He is regarded as one of the most legendary players of the Brazilian football history. He played as a main striker (or centre forward) for Sport Club do Recife, C.R. Vasco da Gama, S.E. Palmeiras and the Brazil national football team.

Network File System

Network File System (NFS) is a file system protocol. It was originally developed by Sun Microsystems in 1984. Using NFS, a user on a client computer can access files over a network in the same way as if they were attached to its local disks. NFS uses the Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (ONC RPC) system. The Network File System is an open standard defined in RFCs. That way, anyone can implement the protocol.

NFS became the first widely used network file system. Other notable network file systems are Andrew File System (AFS), NetWare Core Protocol (NCP), and Server Message Block (SMB) which is also known as Common Internet File System (CIFS).

Appendix (anatomy)

In human anatomy, the appendix (or vermiform appendix; also cecal [or caecal] appendix; vermix; or vermiform process) is a blind ended tube connected to the cecum (or caecum). 

The caecum is a pouch-like part of the colon. The appendix is near the junction of the small intestine and the large intestine. The term "vermiform" comes from Latin and means "worm-like in appearance". Its length is approximately 4 to 6 centimetres.

The appendix has no apparent function in humans, but it can get inflamed and cause diseases (like appendicitis). In us, it is a vestigial organ. It is assumed the appendix may act as a storage for beneficial ("good") gut bacteria which aid us on digesting difficult food and fighting germs.

Darwin suggested that the appendix was perhaps used to digest leaves as primates. Over time, humans have eaten fewer vegetables and have evolved. Over thousands of years, this organ has become smaller to make room for the stomach. It is a vestigial organ which has degraded to nearly nothing in the course of evolution.

Herbivorous mammals such as the Koala have large appendices, and usually other adaptations as well. Cellulose, from plant cell walls, is hard to break down. The cecum of the koala is attached to the juncture of the small and large intestines as it is in humans, but is very long. This enables it to host bacteria specific for cellulose breakdown.

Early man’s ancestor may have also relied upon this system and lived on a diet rich in foliage. As man began to eat foods easier to digest, they became less reliant on cellulose-rich plants for energy.

Recent work shows the appendix is a safe place for useful bacteria when illness flushes those bacteria from the rest of the intestines. This proposal is based on a new understanding of how the immune system supports the growth of beneficial gut flora, in combination with many well-known features of the appendix, including its architecture, its location just below the normal one-way flow of food and germs in the large intestine, and its association with copious amounts of immune tissue. Research performed at Winthrop University-Hospital showed that individuals without an appendix were four times more likely to have a recurrence of "Clostridium difficile" colitis. The appendix, therefore, may act as a "safe house" for commensal ("good") bacteria. This reservoir of gut flora could then serve to repopulate the digestive system following a bout of dysentery or cholera.

Candiru

Candiru (candirú) (Spanish, also known as canero or toothpick fish) are parasitic freshwater catfish and a member of the Trichomycteridae family. They can be found in the Amazon River and to the people who live there, they are the most feared fish in its waters, even over the piranha. They are eel-shaped and translucent, making them very difficult to see in the water. Some species have been known to grow to a size of 6 inches (~15 cm) in length.

The area that has the most of these fish is at the section between the Amazon River and the Rio Negro, near Brazil's inland city of Manaus.

Candiru are parasites. Their ability to find breath currents in the water allows them to swim into the gill openings of other aquatic species, where they feed on their prey's blood.

While the fish in the subfamily Vandelliinae feed on blood, fish in Stegophilinae may feed on scales, mucus, or carrion.

To hunt for its prey, the Candirú lies at the bottom of the river testing and sniffing the water for certain chemicals, such as urea and ammonia from the gills of other fish. Once they have found a fish nearby they rush with a burst of speed to the gill cavity and attaches itself with its spines. Then, it begins to gnaw a hole towards a major blood vessel and stuffs itself for no more than a few minutes, which usually causes the victim to die. It will then release itself and sink back to the river bed in order to digest its food and wait for its next meal. 

These smaller species are known for being thought to invade and make use of a person's urethra. Even with reports as old as the 1800s, the first written case of the removal of a candiru from a person did not occur until 1997, and even that incident is not believed by everyone. The idea that the fish are attracted by urine appears to be not right. The fish actually hunt by sight and do not like urine at all.

Slide rule

The slide rule, or "slipstick", is a mechanical analog computer. The slide rule is used mainly for multiplication and division, and also for "scientific" functions such as roots, logarithms and trigonometry, but usually not for addition or subtraction.

There are many different styles of slide rules. They are usually linear or circular. They have a standardised set of markings or scales. These scales are used for mathematical computations. Some slide rules have been made for special use, as for aviation or finance. Those slide rules have special scales for those applications, as well as normal scales.

The slide rule is based on the work on logarithms by John Napier and was invented by William Oughtred. Before electronic calculators were developed, slide rules were the tool used most often in science and engineering. The use of slide rules continued to grow through the 1950s and 1960s even as digital computing devices were gradually introduced; but around 1974 the pocket calculator made the slide rule largely obsolete and most suppliers left the business.
In its most basic form, the slide rule uses two logarithmic scales to allow rapid multiplication and division of numbers. These common operations can be time-consuming and error-prone when done on paper. More complex slide rules allow other calculations, such as square roots, exponentials, logarithms, and trigonometric functions.
Mathematical calculations are done by aligning a mark on the sliding central strip with one on one of the fixed strips. The relative position of other marks can then be observed. Numbers aligned with the marks give the approximate value of the product, quotient, or other calculated result.

The user determines the location of the decimal point in the result, based on mental estimation. Scientific notation is used to track the decimal point in more formal calculations. Addition and subtraction steps in a calculation are generally done mentally or on paper, not on the slide rule.

Most slide rules have three linear strips of the same length. The strips are aligned in parallel and interlocked so that the central strip can be moved lengthwise relative to the other two. The outer two strips are fixed so that their relative positions do not change.

Some slide rules ("duplex" models) have scales on both sides of the rule and slide strip, others on one side of the outer strips and both sides of the slide strip, still others on one side only ("simplex" rules). A sliding cursor with a vertical alignment line is used to find corresponding points on scales that are not next to each other or, in duplex models, are on the other side of the rule. The cursor can also record an intermediate result on any of the scales. 

A logarithm transforms the operations of multiplication and division to addition and subtraction according to the rules formula_1 and formula_2. Moving the top scale to the right by a distance of formula_3, by matching the beginning of the top scale with the label formula_4 on the bottom, aligns each number formula_5, at position formula_6 on the top scale, with the number at position formula_7 on the bottom scale. Because formula_8, this position on the bottom scale gives formula_9, the product of formula_4 and formula_5. For example, to calculate 3 × 2 (represented as 3*2 on a calculator), the 1 on the top scale is moved to the 2 on the bottom scale. The answer, 6, is read off the bottom scale where 3 is on the top scale. In general, the 1 on the top is moved to a factor on the bottom, and the answer is read off the bottom where the other factor is on the top.

Operations may go "off the scale;" for example, the diagram above shows that the slide rule has not positioned the 7 on the upper scale above any number on the lower scale, so it does not give any answer for 2×7. In such cases, the user may slide the upper scale to the left until its right index aligns with the 2, effectively multiplying by 0.2 instead of by 2, as in the illustration below:

Here the user of the slide rule must remember to adjust the decimal point appropriately to correct the final answer. We wanted to find 2×7, but instead we calculated 0.2×7=1.4. So the true answer is not 1.4 but 14. Resetting the slide is not the only way to handle multiplications that would result in off-scale results, such as 2×7; some other methods are:


Method 1 is easy to understand, but entails a loss of precision. Method 3 has the advantage that it only involves two scales.

The illustration below demonstrates the computation of 5.5/2. The 2 on the top scale is placed over the 5.5 on the bottom scale. The 1 on the top scale lies above the quotient, 2.75. There is more than one method for doing division, but the method presented here has the advantage that the final result cannot be off-scale, because one has a choice of using the 1 at either end.

In addition to the logarithmic scales, some slide rules have other mathematical functions on other scales. The most popular were trigonometric, usually sine and tangent, common logarithm (log) (for taking the log of a value on a multiplier scale), natural logarithm (ln) and exponential ("e") scales. Some rules include a Pythagorean scale, to figure sides of triangles, and a scale to figure circles. Others feature scales for calculating hyperbolic functions. On linear rules, the scales and their labeling are highly standardized, with variation usually occurring only in terms of which scales are included and in what order:

The Binary Slide Rule manufactured by Gilson in 1931 performed an addition and subtraction function limited to fractions.

There are single-decade (C and D), double-decade (A and B), and triple-decade (K) scales. To compute formula_12, for example, locate x on the D scale and read its square on the A scale. Inverting this process allows square roots to be found, and similarly for the powers 3, 1/3, 2/3, and 3/2. Care must be taken when the base, x, is found in more than one place on its scale. For instance, there are two nines on the A scale; to find the square root of nine, use the first one; the second one gives the square root of 90.

For formula_13 problems, use the LL scales. When several LL scales are present, use the one with x on it. First, align the leftmost 1 on the C scale with x on the LL scale. Then, find y on the C scale and go down to the LL scale with x on it. That scale will indicate the answer. If y is "off the scale," locate formula_14 and square it using the A and B scales as described above.

The S, T, and ST scales are used for trigonometric functions and multiples of trig functions, for angles in degrees. Many slide rules have their S, T, and ST scales marked with degrees and minutes. D"ecitrig" models use decimal fractions of degrees instead.

Base-10 logarithms and exponentials are found using the L scale, which is linear. Some slide rules have a Ln scale, which is for base e.

The Ln scale was invented by an 11th grade student, Stephen B. Cohen, in 1958. The original intent was to allow the user to select an exponent "x" (in the range 0 to 2.3) on the Ln scale and read e on the C (or D) scale and e on the CI (or DI) scale. Pickett, Inc. was given exclusive rights to the scale. Later, the inventor created a set of "marks" on the Ln scale to extend the range beyond the 2.3 limit, but Pickett never incorporated these marks on any of its slide rules.

Slide rules are not much used for addition and subtraction, but it is nevertheless possible to do so using two different techniques.

The first method to perform addition and subtraction on the C and D (or any comparable scales) requires converting the problem into one of division. For addition, the quotient of the two variables plus one times the divisor equals their sum:

For subtraction, the quotient of the two variables minus one times the divisor equals their difference:

This method is similar to the addition/subtraction technique used for high-speed electronic circuits with the logarithmic number system in specialized computer applications like the Gravity Pipe (GRAPE) supercomputer and hidden Markov models.

The second method uses a sliding linear L scale available on some models. Addition and subtraction are performed by sliding the cursor left (for subtraction) or right (for addition) then returning the slide to 0 to read the result.

The length of the slide rule is quoted in terms of the nominal length of the scales. Scales on the most common "10-inch" models are actually 25 cm in length, as they were made to metric standards, though some rules offer slightly extended scales to simplify manipulation when a result overflowed. Pocket rules are typically 5 inches. Models a couple of meters long were sold to be hung in classrooms for teaching purposes. 

Typically the divisions mark a scale to a precision of two significant figures, and the user estimates the third figure. Some high-end slide rules have magnifying cursors that make the markings easier to see. Such cursors can effectively double the accuracy of readings, permitting a 10-inch slide rule to serve as well as a 20-inch.

Trigonometric scales are sometimes dual-labeled, in black and red, with complementary angles, the so-called "Darmstadt" style. Duplex slide rules often duplicate some of the scales on the back. Scales are often "split" to get higher accuracy.

Specialized slide rules were invented for various forms of engineering, business and banking. These often had common calculations directly expressed as special scales, for example loan calculations, optimal purchase quantities, or particular engineering equations. For example, the Fisher Controls company distributed a customized slide rule adapted to solving the equations used for selecting the proper size of industrial flow control valves.

Circular slide rules come in two basic types, one with two cursors (left), and another with a movable disk and a single cursor (right). The dual cursor versions perform multiplication and division by maintaining a fixed angle between the cursors as they are rotated around the dial. The single cursor version operates more like the standard slide rule through the appropriate alignment of the scales.

The basic advantage of a circular slide rule is that the longest dimension of the tool was reduced by a factor of about 3 (i.e. by π). For example, the outer scale of a 10 cm circular would have a maximum precision equal to a 30 cm ordinary slide rule. Circular slide rules also eliminate "off-scale" calculations, because the scales were designed to "wrap around"; they never have to be re-oriented when results are near 1.0—the rule is always on scale. However, for non-cyclical non-spiral scales such as S, T, and LL's, the scale length is shortened to make room for end margins.

Circular slide rules are mechanically more rugged and smoother-moving, but their scale alignment precision is sensitive to the centering of a central pivot; a minute 0.1 mm off-centre of the pivot can result in a 0.2 mm worst case alignment error. The pivot prevents scratching of the face and cursors. The highest accuracy scales are placed on the outer rings. Rather than "split" scales, high-end circular rules use spiral scales for more complex operations like log-of-log scales. One eight-inch premium circular rule had a 50-inch spiral log-log scale.

The main disadvantages of circular slide rules are the difficulty in locating figures along a rotating disc, and limited number of scales. Another drawback of circular slide rules is that less-important scales are closer to the center, and have lower precisions. Most students learned slide rule use on the linear slide rules, and did not find reason to switch.

One slide rule remaining in daily use around the world is the E6B. This is a circular slide rule first created in the 1930s for aircraft pilots to help with dead reckoning. With the aid of scales printed on the frame it also helps with such tasks as converting time, distance, speed, and temperature values, compass errors, and calculating fuel use. The so-called "prayer wheel" is still available in flight shops, and remains widely used. While GPS has reduced the use of dead reckoning for aerial navigation, and handheld calculators have taken over many of its functions, the E6B remains widely used as a primary or backup device and the majority of flight schools demand that their students can use it.

In 1952, Swiss watch company Breitling introduced a pilot's wristwatch with an integrated circular slide rule specialized for flight calculations: the Breitling Navitimer. The Navitimer circular rule, referred to by Breitling as a "navigation computer", featured airspeed, rate/time of climb/descent, flight time, distance, and fuel consumption functions, as well as kilometer–nautical mile and gallon–liter fuel amount conversion functions.

Traditionally slide rules were made out of hard wood such as mahogany or boxwood with cursors of glass and metal. At least one high precision instrument was made of steel.

In 1895, a Japanese firm, Hemmi, started to make slide rules from bamboo, which had the advantages of being dimensionally stable, strong and naturally self-lubricating. These bamboo slide rules were introduced in Sweden in September, 1933 , and probably only a little earlier in Germany. Scales were made of celluloid or plastic. Later slide rules were made of plastic, or aluminum painted with plastic. Later cursors were acrylics or polycarbonates sliding on Teflon bearings.

The best slide rules had numbers and scales engraved, and then filled with paint or other resin. Painted or imprinted slide rules were viewed as inferior because the markings could wear off. Nevertheless, Pickett, probably America's most successful slide rule company, made all printed scales. Premium slide rules included clever catches so the rule would not fall apart by accident, and bumpers to protect the scales and cursor from rubbing on tabletops. The recommended cleaning method for engraved markings is to scrub lightly with steel-wool. For painted slide rules, and the faint of heart, use diluted commercial window-cleaning fluid and a soft cloth.

The slide rule was invented around 1620–1630, shortly after John Napier's publication of the concept of the logarithm. Edmund Gunter of Oxford developed a calculating device with a single logarithmic scale, which, with additional measuring tools, could be used to multiply and divide. The first description of this scale was published in Paris in 1624 by Edmund Wingate (c. 1593 – 1656), an English mathematician, in a book entitled "“L'usage de la reigle de proportion en l'arithmetique & geometrie”." The book contains a double scale on one side of which is a logarithmic scale and on the other a tabular scale. In 1630, William Oughtred of Cambridge invented a circular slide rule, and in 1632 he combined two Gunter rules, held together with the hands, to make a device that is recognizably the modern slide rule. Like his contemporary at Cambridge, Isaac Newton, Oughtred taught his ideas privately to his students, but delayed in publishing them, and like Newton, he became involved in a vitriolic controversy over priority, with his one-time student Richard Delamain and the prior claims of Wingate. Oughtred's ideas were only made public in publications of his student William Forster in 1632 and 1653.

In 1677, Henry Coggeshall created a two-foot folding rule for timber measure, called the Coggeshall slide rule. His design and uses for the tool gave the slide rule purpose outside of mathematical inquiry.

In 1722, Warner introduced the two- and three-decade scales, and in 1755 Everard included an inverted scale; a slide rule containing all of these scales is usually known as a "polyphase" rule.

In 1815, Peter Roget invented the log log slide rule, which included a scale displaying the logarithm of the logarithm. This allowed the user to directly perform calculations involving roots and exponents. This was especially useful for fractional powers.

The more modern form was created in 1859 by French artillery lieutenant Amédée Mannheim, "who was fortunate in having his rule made by a firm of national reputation and in having it adopted by the French Artillery." It was around that time, as engineering became a recognized professional activity, that slide rules came into wide use in Europe. They did not become common in the United States until 1881, when Edwin Thacher introduced a cylindrical rule there. The duplex rule was invented by William Cox in 1891, and was produced by Keuffel and Esser Co. of New York.

Astronomical work also required fine computations, and in 19th century Germany a steel slide rule about 2 meters long was used at one observatory. It had a microscope attached, giving it accuracy to six decimal places.

In World War II, bombardiers and navigators who required quick calculations often used specialized slide rules. One office of the U.S. Navy actually designed a generic slide rule "chassis" with an aluminum body and plastic cursor into which celluloid cards (printed on both sides) could be placed for special calculations. The process was invented to calculate range, fuel use and altitude for aircraft, and then adapted to many other purposes.
Throughout the 1950s and 1960s the slide rule was the symbol of the engineer's profession (in the same way that the stethoscope symbolizes the medical profession). German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun brought two 1930s vintage "Nestler" slide rules with him when he moved to the U.S. after World War II to work on the American space program. Throughout his life he never used any other pocket calculating devices. Slide rules served him perfectly well for making quick estimates of rocket design parameters and other figures. Aluminum Pickett-brand slide rules were carried on five Apollo space missions, including to the moon, according to advertising on Pickett's N600 slide rule boxes .

Some engineering students and engineers carried ten-inch slide rules in belt holsters, and even into the mid 1970s this was a common sight on campuses. Students also might keep a ten-or twenty-inch rule for precision work at home or the office while carrying a five-inch pocket slide rule around with them.

In 2004, education researchers David B. Sher and Dean C. Nataro conceived a new type of slide rule based on "prosthaphaeresis", an algorithm for rapidly computing products that predates logarithms. There has been little practical interest in constructing one beyond the initial prototype, however. 

The importance of the slide rule began to diminish as electronic computers, a new but very scarce resource in the 1950s, became widely available to technical workers during the 1960s. The introduction of Fortran in 1957 made computers practical for solving modest size mathematical problems. IBM introduced a series of more affordable computers, the IBM 650 (1954), IBM 1620 (1959), IBM 1130 (1965) addressed to the science and engineering market. John Kemeny's BASIC programming language (1964) made it easy for students to use computers. The DEC PDP-8 minicomputer was introduced in 1965.

Computers also changed the nature of calculation. With slide rules, there was a great emphasis on working the algebra to get expressions into the most computable form. Users of slide rules would simply approximate or drop small terms to simplify the calculation. Fortran allowed complicated formulas to be typed in from textbooks without the effort of reformulation. Numerical integration was often easier than trying to find closed form solutions for difficult problems. The young engineer asking for computer time to solve a problem that could have been done by a few swipes on the slide rule became a humorous cliché. Many computer centers had a framed slide rule hung on a wall with the note "In case of emergency, break glass."

Another step toward the replacement of slide rules with electronics was the development of electronic calculators for scientific and engineering use. The first included the Wang Laboratories LOCI-2, introduced in 1965, which used logarithms for multiplication and division and the Hewlett-Packard HP-9100, introduced in 1968. The HP-9100 had trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan) in addition to exponentials and logarithms. It used the CORDIC (coordinate rotation digital computer) algorithm, which allows for calculation of trigonometric functions using only shift and add operations. This method helped the development of ever smaller scientific calculators.

The last nail in the coffin for the slide rule was the launch of pocket-sized scientific calculators. The 1972 Hewlett-Packard HP-35 was the first. Such calculators became known as "slide rule" calculators since they could perform most or all of the functions on a slide rule. At several hundred dollars, even this was considered expensive for most students. While professional slide rules could also be quite expensive, drug stores often sold basic plastic models for under $20 USD. But by 1975, basic four-function electronic calculators could be purchased for under $50. By 1976 the TI-30 offered a scientific calculator for under $25. The market for slide rules dried up quickly as small scientific calculators became affordable.


One advantage of using a slide rule together with an electronic calculator is that an important calculation can be checked by doing it on both; because the two instruments are so different, there is little chance of making the same mistake twice.

The Great Gatsby

The Great Gatsby is a novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It was first sold in 1925. The novel takes place in New York City and Long Island in New York.

"The Great Gatsby" is one of the most popular books in the United States. The book was number two on the Modern Library Association's list of "100 Best Novels of the 20th Century." "Time Magazine" put the book in its "TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005". A 1989 study found that 54% of the high schools that were surveyed taught "The Great Gatsby" in their English classes.

The story is told by Nick Carraway, a man who moves to Long Island, New York, from the Midwest. Nick is not rich, but he lives in a rich area that has two towns called East Egg and West Egg. The "old rich" live in East Egg while the "new rich" live in West Egg. Nick lives in a small house in West Egg. Nick's next-door neighbor is Jay Gatsby. Jay is in love with Nick's cousin Daisy. However, Daisy is married to a man named Tom. The novel is about Jay and his hope that he can steal Daisy from Tom.

The events of the novel happen in the summer of 1922. Nick Carraway, a man who grew up in the American Midwest, is the narrator. Nick is a World War I veteran and a Yale University graduate who wants a more exciting life. He moves to New York, to be a bonds salesman. There, he rents a house in the small community of West Egg. The person living next to him is Jay Gatsby, a strange man who also has a lot of money. Jay Gatsby also hosts many expensive parties frequently. Strangely, he never joins in his own parties. Because people don't know him, many rumors are made about Gatsby's true identity and background. Nick drives out to visit his cousin Daisy in East Egg. There, he meets her husband, Tom Buchanan. He is also introduced to her friend, Jordan Baker. Nick learns from her that Tom has been having an affair with Myrtle Wilson. Nick decides to hold his judgment.

Later in the summer, Nick is invited to one of Gatsby's parties. He meets Gatsby there. Gatsby is a young and charming man. Nick learns that Gatsby was in love with Daisy many years ago. Gatsby is still in love with her. He spends many nights looking across the water from his mansion at the green light from Daisy's dock. He is hoping that he can impress Daisy with his rich lifestyle and wild parties. Gatsby grew up very poor and with little chance to move up in the world. This made Gatsby try to get much money to become a different person. If he is rich, he thinks he will be right for Daisy. Gatsby asks Nick to arrange a meeting between Daisy and himself. Nick invites them both over for tea, and they begin to fall in love again. They then start an affair with each other.

Tool

Tools are things used to make tasks easier. Tools have changed over time. The first tools were made in the Stone Age and Bronze Age. Throughout history, people have made many new and more complicated tools.

Some examples of tools that are often used today are the hammer, the wrench (also called a spanner), saws, shovel, telephone, and the computer. Very basic things like knives, pens, and pencils are also tools. The bludgeon (a stick or rock used as a weapon to smash things) was one of the first tools made by humans. The knife is also one of the first tools humans made.

A "hand tool" is powered by the muscles of the person using it. Most hand tools are hand-held (small enough to be carried and used in the hands). Hammers, wrenches, and knives are examples of hand tools.

A "power tool" is powered by another source of energy like electricity. A power tool is otherwise similar to a hand tool. Most power tools are also hand-held or portable (small enough to be easily moved). Hand-held electric drills and chainsaws are examples of power tools.

Urea

Urea is an organic compound. It was first found in urine in 1773 by the French chemist Jean Rouelle. It is also called Carbamide, and its chemical names are Carbonyl Diamide (used in inorganic chemistry) and Diaminomethanal (used in organic chemistry).

In humans, it is a normal component of blood and many body tissues. It is produced in the liver, where ammonia, a very toxic substance, is changed into urea, which has a very low toxicity, so low in fact, that it is many times less toxic than table salt. Most of the urea produced in this way is not needed by the body, and is removed from the blood in the kidneys and taken out of the body in urine.

Mucus

Mucus (mucous), or slime, is a slippery liquid. It is made by many living things as a kind of biological lubricant. It plays the role in living things which oil plays in machines. 

Mucus is mainly composed of polysaccharides, which are long-chain carbohydrates. These molecules are stiff when dry, and sticky and slippery when wet. They are present in all types of organisms from bacteria to humans. 

In vertebrates mucus is made by mucous membranes. Mucus may have antiseptic enzymes (such as lysozymes) and immunoglobulins (antigens). A major function of this mucus is to protect against infection by fungi, bacteria and viruses. 

Mucus protects epithelial cells in the lungs, gut, genital, visual, and auditory systems in mammals; the epidermis in amphibians; and the gills in fish. Snails, slugs, hagfish, and certain invertebrates also produce external mucus. As well as a protective function, slime helps movement and plays a role in communication. 

Mucus is produced in many parts of the body. All the alimentary canal, nose, and sexual organs have mucus glands which pass the mucus to the surfaces. The surfaces are mostly internal surfaces, though in some animals mucus covers the outside of the animal. Slugs are an example of this. Mucus glands are exocrine glands, so they pass their mucus to the surface along ducts.

In the human digestive system, mucus is used as a lubricant for materials that must pass over membranes, such as food passing down the oesophagus. 

A layer of mucus along the inner walls of the stomach is vital to protect the cell linings from the highly acidic environment inside the stomach. Mucus is not digested in the intestinal tract. 

Alkaline mucus is also found in other places, such as eyes, saliva and cervix.

Actias luna

The luna moth ("Actias luna") is a species of moth. It is in the family Saturniidae. The luna moth is thought to be North America's most beautiful insect.

The luna moth has a wingspan of 7.5 to 10.5 cm. The wings are lime-green. The bottom wings have long tails. There is a clear spot on each wing. There is a reddish-brown border on the top edge of the top wing. Some individuals have pinkish borders on the outer edge of both wings. Other individuals have yellowish borders instead. Adult luna moths have no mouth, and live on the fat they stored up at the larval stage. Because of this, they only live for about a week.

The luna moth is found in North America. It is found from Nova Scotia, west to North Dakota, south to Texas, and east to Florida.

The luna moth is found in habitats such as woodlands and forests.

The luna moth is seen from May to July in the northern part of its range. It is seen from March to September in the southern part of its range.

The luna moth's eggs are brown. The caterpillar is green. It has bright red spots on its body. There are two yellow stripes that run down each side of the body. The caterpillar will grow to 6.5 cm long. The luna moth caterpillar is similar to the polyphemus moth ("Antheraea polyphemus") caterpillar. The polyphemus moth caterpillar does not have yellow stripes on its body. The luna moth's cocoon is made of dead leaves on the ground. It overwinters (spends the winter) as a cocoon. The luna moth lays eggs once each year in the northern part of its range. It has three broods per year in the southern part of its range.

The caterpillars feed on the following host plants:

Syrian hamster

The Syrian hamster ("Mesocricetus auratus"), also known as the golden hamster, is a breed of hamster. They first lived in Syria. They are also known as golden hamsters because the first ones kept as pets were gold coloured. Now there are over 100 different colours because of selective breeding. Little is known about their life in the wild. They are kept as pets in many countries including the United States, Canada most countries in Europe and many more.

A Syrian hamster's anatomy is similar to other rodents. It is very close to other hamsters.

Syrian hamsters have 16 teeth. There are 4 incisors and 12 molars. There is a space between the incisors and the molars. That space is called the diastema.

The spine, like in other animals, is made up of several bones called vertebrae. A Syrian hamster has 43-44 vertebrae. Thirteen to fourteen of them are in the tail.

All hamsters have short legs. Because of this, their legs have small bones which can get broken more easily. Obese hamsters are more likely to have problems with their legs.

Syrian hamsters have, like most animals, five senses. They can see, hear, touch, taste and smell. Although they don't see well in daylight, they are not colorblind: Syrian hamsters are nocturnal and can see blue-green colours but not red colours. They use their sense of smell to locate food, and their taste buds function in the same way as human tongues do.

Not much is known about Syrian hamster breeding in the wild. They have been bred well in captivity (i.e. in labs, by breeders and when kept as pets). People have learned a lot about their breeding. Breeding in captivity is probably the same as in the wild.

Syrian hamsters are believed to have the shortest gestation period of any animal. Their gestation is 16 days.

They also have a short ovulation period. Syrian hamsters come into heat once every 4 days for about 1-2 hours.

The lifespan of a Syrian hamster is typically 2 to 3 years; however, it can occasionally be 4 years. Their longevity is influenced by genetics, environment, diet, activity, veterinary treatment, and stress. Providing them with the best possible care, which includes a healthy diet, roomy living quarters, mental stimulation, and careful handling, will improve their general well-being and lengthen their stay with you.

Tropical Storm Nana (2008)

Tropical Storm Nana was the fourteenth tropical storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm formed in early October from a tropical wave with a nearby low pressure area. The wave moved west-northwest with a small amount of convection, before being completely organized enough to become a tropical depression while west of the Cape Verde Islands. It became a tropical storm later that same day, and began weakening almost right away thereafter as it moved in to an area of higher vertical wind shear. The storm finally died out early on October 15. Nana did not have an effect on any land areas or ships.

A tropical wave moved west, awat from the western coast of Africa on October 6. This wave continued moving west with just a little bit of convection until October 8, when organized cloud bands began to form around its low-level center. The wave continued moving westward and organizing until it was called a tropical depression early on October 12, west of the Cape Verde Islands. It began moving towards the west-northwest because of a weakness in the subtropical ridge while becoming stronger to its strongest point of . As it did so, it went into an area of strong upper level winds, which began moving the thunderstorm clouds to the east of the center of circulation. Just twelve hours later, it had weakened back into a tropical depression, and by October 14 it had weakened back to just little more than a low-level cloud swirl. It died out early the next day as it combined itself with a powerful front, east-northeast of the Leeward Islands.

Tropical Storm Nana's formation was expected for a few days before it actually developed. Movement and strength predictions were also better than the long term average. Because of Nana's short life the sample size is not very meaningful. Tropical Storm Nana stayed in the middle of the Atlantic and never came near land. As a result, it had no known impact. No ships reported strong winds that came from the tropical storm.


Sample size

In statistics, the sample size of a sample is the number of observations that make up it. It is usually denoted as "n", a positive integer (natural number).

For large sample sizes of 30 or more, statistics describing the samples tend to be more reliable. As a result, statistical analysis is easier with large samples than with small samples. In research, sample sizes are often calculated before the experiment are conducted to make sure that the desired conditions can be met.


Accumulated cyclone energy

Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) is a measure used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to show the activity of each tropical cyclones and entire tropical cyclone seasons, particularly the Atlantic hurricane seasons. It uses an estimation of the energy used by a tropical system over its lifetime and is calculated in every six hours.

2006 Central Pacific cyclone

The 2006 Central Pacific cyclone, also called 91C.INVEST or Storm 91C, was a strange weather event in 2006. Forming on October 30 from a mid-latitude cyclone in the north Pacific mid-latitudes, it moved over waters warmer-than-normal. It got some characteristics more normal for subtropical or even tropical cyclones. However, as it came closer to western North America, it fell apart. Moisture from its remains then caused a lot of rainfall in British Columbia.

A cut-off extratropical cyclone over the central north Pacific moved into a place with sea surface temperatures as high as 2 °C above normal for two days. By October 31 the system had gotton convection, a warmer-than-normal core, and an eye-like characteristic. During this time it had moved east, then northeast, and then northwest.

On November 1, the system had estimated winds of 100 km/h (60 mph) and its most developed convection. After that, it slowly weakened, moved counter-clockwise, and headed east towards the west coast of North America. On November 2, wind shear started affecting the storm, and all convection was gone by the next day, when it was located roughly 520 mi (840 km) off the coast of Oregon.

This system's center of circulation passed south of observation buoy 46637 on November 1. The buoy's lowest pressure reading was 989 mb/hPa. Other buoys indicated that a rather large area of low pressure was associated with the system. Buoy 46637 was not at the system's center of circulation, so it is possible that this system had a lower minimum pressure than was actually measured.

As a result, to the weather system, the American National Weather Service gave out wind watches for the Oregon Coast. The system brought heavy rain to parts of Vancouver Island.

If Storm 91C is really a tropical or subtropical cyclone, it has several records. Since right now it is not officially either, its holding these records is also unofficial. Because the storm formed at 36°N, this system is the northernmost formation in the eastern north Pacific basin. The previous record-holder was Tropical Storm Wene, which formed at 32°N before crossing the dateline. In addition, this system's track data shows that it crossed from the central to the east Pacific because it formed at longitude 149°W and dissipated at 135°W. Only two other known tropical cyclones had done that before.

This system has been thought to be a tropical, subtropical, or extratropical cyclone.

Mark Guishard, a meteorologist with Bermuda Weather Service, had the opinion that the system had finished tropical cyclogenesis and was a tropical cyclone. Meteorologist Mark Lander thought that cloud tops were similar to several Atlantic hurricanes, Hurricane Vince in example. James Franklin, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center, thought that:
The system was of frontal origin... the frontal structure was eventually lost... The convective structure resembled a tropical, rather than subtropical cyclone, and the radius of maximum winds (based on QuikSCAT) was very close to the center, also more typical of tropical cyclones... on balance, it was more tropical than subtropical.
Clark Evans of Florida State University reported that forecasting tools showed that the system's structure was same with that of a subtropical or barely tropical cyclone. NASA, which is not a meteorological agency, thought that the system was a subtropical cyclone.

In its review of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season, the Canadian Hurricane Centre said that the storm was to be an extratropical cyclone. Since this system had one-minute sustained winds of 100 km/h (60 mi/h), which are above the 60 km/h (39 mi/h) boundary between a depression and a storm, it would be able to be a named storm if it was a tropical or subtropical cyclone. However, neither of the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers for the eastern north Pacific, the National Hurricane Center and the Central Pacific Hurricane Centre, include this system in their yearly archives, nor is it included in the official "best track" file. So this system is not an official tropical or subtropical cyclone of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season.

Tropical cyclone basins

Traditionally, areas of tropical cyclone formation are divided into seven basins. These include the north Atlantic Ocean, the eastern and western parts of the Pacific Ocean (considered separately because tropical cyclones rarely form in the central Pacific), the southwestern Pacific, the southwestern and southeastern Indian Oceans, and the northern Indian Ocean.

Received Pronunciation

Received Pronunciation (or "RP", or "BBC English") is the name given to the standard accent of English used by the British Broadcasting Corporation. It is used most often in the south of England, and by some people all over Britain. It is more often called "Standard English".

Foreign students of British English learn this kind of English at school. The British pronunciation of words given in dictionaries is in Received Pronunciation. Received Pronunciation is used because the 20th century saw the coming of radio and television. Before then, regional dialects were more used. Education beyond elementary level was not available for most people. Schooling ended at 12 in 1910, and at 14 as late as 1950. Until about 1960 in England, most people lived near where they were born. Regional accents were strong in the West and North of England.

The study of RP is about pronunciation only. Other terms, such as Standard English, the Queen's English, Oxford English, and BBC English, are also concerned with grammar, vocabulary, and style.

Received Pronunciation is non-rhotic. This means that in words ending with an 'r', for example "car", the final 'r' is not pronounced.
Many words have long vowel sounds. For example, the 'a' in 'bath' rhymes is the same as in 'far', not the same as in 'cat'.

There are other features which need a training in phonology to be properly understood. Avoidance of the glottal stop would be one example.

Ion Ivanovici

Ion Ivanovici (alternatively, Iosif Ivanovici, Josef Ivanovici, baptised as Jovan Ivanović) (born 1845 in Timişoara, died 28 September 1902 in Bucharest) was a Romanian military band leader and composer. 

Today Ivanovici is especially remembered for his waltz "The Waves of the Danube", Donauwellen in German, in his lifetime he composed over 350 dances, and his works were published by over sixty publishing houses throughout the world. In 1889, Ivanovici won the much-desired march prize to mark the World Exhibition in Paris, out of 116 entries.

Ivanovici's Dabube Waves was first published in the U.S. in 1896, and republished in 1903, by the Theodore Lohr Company in an arrangement for piano by Simon Adler. The published version was called "Waves of the Danube". The composition is most commonly known as "Danube Waves Waltz".


Mihai Eminescu

Pan flute

The pan flute or pan pipe (also known as panflute or panpipes) is an old musical instrument that has five or more pipes of gradually increasing length (and, at times, girth). The pan flute has been a folk instrument, and is considered the first mouth organ, ancestor of both the pipe organ and the harmonica.


Autocephaly

Autocephaly is the status of a church where the bishop does not report to a higher ranking bishop.

Getae

The Getae (, singular Γέτης) was the name given by the Greeks and Romans to several Thracian tribes who lived in the region south of the Lower Danube. It is now known today as northern Bulgaria, and north of the Lower Danube, in Romania.

They spoke the ancient Thracian language like their neighbors, the Dacians. There was also a branch of Tyragetae on the Dniester River, and two tribes of Massagetae and Thyssagetae in Scythia. Many historians of the 4th to 6th centuries AD referred to the Goths, who then lived in the same area north of the Danube, as "Getae".

Dacians

The Dacians were an Indo-European people, the ancient inhabitants of Dacia (located in the area in and around the Carpathian mountains and east of there to the Black Sea), present-day Romania and Moldova, parts of Sarmatia and Scythia Minor in southeastern Europe.

Scythians

The Scythians or Scyths were Iranic nomadic Eurasian peoples.

They were nomadic, famous for their skills at horse riding, who dominated the Pontic steppe (modern Ukraine and Southern Russia) throughout the ancient world. By the 2nd century AD the closely-related Sarmatians came to dominate the Scyths in this area. Much of our information about the Scyths comes from the famous Greek historian Herodotus (c. 440 BC) in his "Histories", and from archaeologically from the beautiful goldwork found in Scythian Kurgan burial mounds in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and southern Russia.

Perpetual motion

Perpetual motion refers to a movement that goes on forever once started without additional energy added. A machine that could be set in motion once would continue to move forever. Such a device or system would be against the law of conservation of energy. This law states that energy cannot be created, or destroyed, but one form of energy can be transformed into a different one. 

Perpetual motion machines have interested inventors for a long time, and even though it has been shown that such a machine cannot exist, people still try to build them.

Perpetual motion machines have been classified into different types. Each type breaks a different law of thermodynamics:

The larvae feed on Scots pine, Swiss pine, Siberian pine and Norway spruce.

"Sphinx pinastri's" wings are gray with black dashes. The wingspan is 2 3/4 - 3 1/2 inches (7–9 cm). The moth flies from April to August depending on the location.

The back of the thorax is grey with two dark bands around both sides.

The females lay their eggs in groups of 2 or 3 along pine or spruce needles.

Tropical Storm Laura (2008)

Tropical Storm Laura was the twelfth named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. Laura formed out of a large non-tropical low pressure area 1015 miles (1635 km) west of the western islands of the Azores on September 29. Laura slowly got tropical characteristics throughout the day as it moved over warmer waters. On the afternoon of September 30, Laura had gotten enough tropical characteristics to be designated as a "Tropical Storm". Soon after becoming tropical, Laura began to start an extratropical transition, which did not completely take place until the morning of October 1. Laura became reduced into a post-tropical cyclone later that morning, and the National Hurricane Center gave out its last advisory on the storm.

In late September, a large non-tropical system over the north-central Atlantic slowly moved westward away from the Azores. The low produced hurricane-force winds, but did not exhibit the characteristics of a tropical cyclone. The storm steadily weakened over the following days, but developed tropical characteristics as it moved over slightly warmer waters. By September 29, the low had developed sufficient convection and was declared Subtropical Storm Laura. Upon being upgraded, cold cloud tops began to wrap around the center of Laura and consolidate near the center of circulation. The convection organized around the center quickly and a satellite pass over the storm revealed that it could be intensifying. A later satellite pass disregarded the possibility of intensification as the intensity was confirmed to be at 60 mph (95 km/h).

The overall structure of Laura remained subtropical but there were indications that it was acquiring tropical characteristics. During the afternoon, satellites revealed that Laura had developed a deep warm core, a characteristic of a tropical cyclone, but the wind field remained subtropical in nature. By the nighttime hours, the radius of the strongest winds contracted to 80 mi (130 km), much smaller than what is typical of a subtropical cyclone. However, Laura was still under the influence of an upper-level low and cloud tops remained shallow. However, the cloud tops became colder overnight and Laura was on the verge of becoming a tropical cyclone by the morning of September 30, but strong interaction with the upper-level low meant it was still subtropical. Despite moving over colder waters, a water vapor satellite image determined that Laura had separated itself from the upper-level low, signifying it had developed into a tropical cyclone. Laura was upgraded to a tropical storm at a relatively high latitude, 41.2°N.

Not long after being declared tropical, early signs of an extratropical transition appeared. Cold air began to enter the storm on the west side and forecast models showed Laura becoming extratropical the next morning and non-tropical later the next day. Overnight, convection associated with Laura began to diminish and lose tropical characteristics, but still retained its status. Early on October 1, the extratropical transition was fully apparent. Laura remained tropical but the cloud pattern was becoming frontal and there was little convection around the center of the system. Laura later degenerated into a post-tropical cyclone, a term that had been previously used by the Canadian Hurricane Centre to describe a storm that has lost tropical characteristics, but is not subtropical or extratropical. The transition was forecasted to be complete by the end of the day.

While Laura was a tropical cyclone, it never came near land, so no effects or damages happened and no one died. But, the storm's remains were caught in an upper-level jet stream, and was pushed towards Europe. Heavy rain fell across parts of Britain, creating localized build up of flood waters. Because of that, Glebe Road near Windermere, England was closed in both directions, and along the A65 road between Old Hutton and Kirkby Lonsdale, previously wet soil, as well with overwhelmed storm drains resulted in localized flooding. Traffic on the M6 Motorway was slowed because of bad driving conditions.

After the remains of now extratropical Laura made its final landfall on the southern coast of the Netherlands, its rain clouds started mix with a cold front related to a well-developed low west of Norway, dropping up to 113 mm (4.5 in) of precipitation in the northwestern Netherlands, flooding streets and homes in the village of Hippolytushoef. More than 10,000 people lost electricity in southern Norway because of damage to the electrical system created by the remains of the storm.



Implied repeal

Implied repeal is a theory on the British constitution that laws can be amended or repealed by an Act of Parliament. If the British Parliament passes two laws about the same subject that state different things, the more recently enacted law states normally what must be done.

The doctrine is expressed in the Latin phrase "leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant" ("more recent laws overwrite earlier laws").

John de Menteith

Sir John de Menteith (c. 1275 – c. 1323) was a Scottish nobleman. On August 3, 1305, William Wallace was captured at Robroyston, near Glasgow. His captor, Sir John Menteith, the ‘false’ Menteith, has gone down in Scottish legend as the betrayer of Wallace, but he acted as many others would have. Menteith was no English lackey, and in 1320 he put his seal to the Declaration of Arbroath.

Digital subscriber line

DSL (for Digital Subscriber Loop or Digital Subscriber Line) is a way to transmit digital data over a telephone line. Telephone lines only transmit a limited spectrum of signals (roughly 20 Hertz to 20,000 Hertz, for voice). This means that the other frequencies can be used to transmit data. The data is combined or multiplexed onto the telephone line. At both ends, a device called a "Splitter" (or DSL filter) separates the data part and the telephony part. DSL provides the physical layer, the lowest layer of the OSI model that is used for understanding how the different parts of a telecommunications network can connect with each other. In this model, ATM or Ethernet are two communications protocols used as the data link layer (layer 2) and IP is used at the network layer (layer 3).

While most DSL signals are multiplexed for transmission onto telephone lines, DSL can also be used without a telephony line (or multiplexed onto something else, for example Cable TV).

At the consumer end, a DSL modem converts the signals to be able to travel on the phone line; at the other end, a DSLAM multiplexes or combines the signals onto the internet backbone of the provider.

Most DSL lines of consumers are asymmetric, meaning that connection speeds or bit rates are different in each direction. Asymmetric DSL is abbreviated as ADSL. 

Typically, the download speed of consumer DSL services ranges from 256 kilobits per second (kbit/s) to 24,000 kbit/s, depending on DSL technology, line conditions and service level implemented. Typically, upload speed is lower than download speed for Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) and equal to download speed for the rarer Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line (SDSL).

DSL (or VDSL, Very High Bitrate Digital Subscriber Line) typically works by dividing the frequencies used in a single phone line into two primary "bands". The ISP data is carried over the high-frequency band (25 kHz and above) while the voice is carried over the lower-frequency band (4 kHz and below). The user typically installs a DSL filter on each phone. This removes the high frequencies from the phone line, so that the phone only sends or receives the lower frequencies (the human voice). The DSL modem and the normal telephone equipment can be used on the line at the same time without interference from each other.

The customer end of the connection consists of a DSL modem, also known as a Terminal Adaptor. The modem converts data from the digital signals used by computers into a voltage signal of a suitable frequency range which is then applied to the phone line for transmission back to the service provider. 

In some DSL variations (for example, High-bit-rate digital subscriber line (HDSL)), the modem is directly connected to the computer via a serial interface, using communication protocols such as RS-232 or V.35. In other cases (particularly ADSL), it is common for the customer equipment to be integrated with other functions, such as routing, firewalling, or other application-specific hardware and software. In this case, the entire equipment is usually referred to as a DSL router or DSL gateway.

Dr. No (movie)

James Bond 007 1 - War of Dr. Julius No is a 1962 James Bond movie. It was directed by Terence Young. The movie is based on the book "Dr. No" by Ian Fleming. It starred Sean Connery as James Bond and Joseph Wiseman as Dr. Julius No.

This is the first movie in which Connery played Bond. The movie is remembered by many people because of the moment when Ursula Andress walks out of the sea in a white bikini. It is also the first time we hear the now famous line "Bond, James Bond" as James Bond introduces himself.

This movie started the James Bond series of movies which are still being made today.

The plot begins in Jamaica, where local English secret agent Strangways and his secretary are killed by three men pretending to be blind beggars, called the "three blind mice". MI6 (the English spy agency) sends their best agent, Bond, to find out why Strangways was killed. He travels to Jamaica, but not before romancing the beautiful Sylvia Trech. Whilst in Jamaica, the Three Blind Mice try to kill Bond. First they try shooting at him and then by chasing him in a car. The second time Bond turns the tables by causing their car (a funeral hearse) to fall off a cliff after a very dangerous car chase. Bond jokes (after seeing their car explode at the bottom) that he thinks they were on their way to a funeral. The deadly Miss Taro also tries to romance (then kill) Bond, and almost succeeds, before Bond realises that she is working for the enemy. Determined to find out who the enemy is, Bond discovers that Strangways was doing some research on an island called Crab Key and it's owner, a mysterious Chinese man called Dr. No.

Bond travels to Crab Key with Quarrel (a local fisherman secretly working for MI6) and Felix leiter (an American spy). Felix goes back to Jamaica when they reach the island, and Bond and Quarrel meet a beautiful shell collector called Honey Rider. After a gunfight with Dr. No's men, Quarrel is killed and Bond and Honey are captured. They finally meet Dr. No who explains to them that he works for the evil organisation SPECTRE(SPecial Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion) and has been hired to "topple" American rockets (making them crash using radio beams). Honey is tied up and sent to be drowned, whereas James is put in a cell with electrified bars. James escapes through the air vents, rescues Honey and murders Dr. No by throwing him into a pool of boiling water. The following chemical reaction wikt:destroys the base and Bond and Honey wikt:escape in a speedboat, just as the base explodes.


British Rail Class D2/12

British Rail Class D2/12 was a locomotive commissioned by British Rail in England. It was a diesel powered locomotive in the pre-TOPS period built by Hudswell Clarke with a Gardner engine.

True Cross

The True Cross is the name given to parts which are believed to be from the actual cross upon which Jesus was crucified.

Empress Helena (c.250–c.330 AD) was the mother of Constantine, the first Christian Emperor of Rome. Christianity was legalised through the Roman Empire in 312. According to the early writers, like Socrates Scolaticus, Helena travelled to the Holy Land, founding churches and establishing relief agencies for the poor. She is said to have discovered the resting place of the three crosses used at the crucifixion of Jesus and the two thieves - Dismas and Gestas - who were executed with him. Through a miracle it was revealed which of the three was the "True Cross".

Many churches have fragmentary remains which are by tradition alleged to be those of the "True Cross." Their authenticity is not accepted by all those of the Christian faith. Many Christians question the accuracy of the reports surrounding the discovery of the "True Cross". The acceptance and belief of that part of the tradition that pertains to the Early Christian Church is generally restricted to the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. The Medieval legends where it came from are not the same in Catholic and Orthodox tradition. These churches honour Helena as a saint, as does also the Anglican Communion.

Some Christians believe that wood from the true cross has miraculous healing powers. During the Middle Ages people made pilgrimages to churches and shrines where pieces of the cross were kept, and touched the wood in the hope of being cured of a sickness or infirmity.

British Rail Class 401

The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designation 2Bil to the DC third rail electric multiple units built during the 1930s to work long-distance semi-fast services on the newly electrified lines from London to Eastbourne, Portsmouth and Reading. This type of unit survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated TOPS Class 401.

British Rail Class 402

The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designation 2Hal to the electric multiple units built during the late 1930s to work long-distance semi-fast services on the newly electrified lines from London to Maidstone and Gillingham (Kent). This type of unit survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated TOPS Class 402.

British Rail Class 403

The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designation 5BEL to the 5-car all-Pullman electric multiple units built to work the prestigious Brighton Belle trains between London Victoria and Brighton. These units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated TOPS Class 403. Between 1933 and 1935 the units were designated 5PUL (the 'PUL' code was then used for the 6PUL units).

British Rail Class 404

The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designations 4Cor, 4Res, 4Buf and 4Gri to the different types of electric multiple unit built to work the route between London Waterloo and Portsmouth Harbour. The 4Cor type units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated TOPS Class 404. The Cor designation had previously been used for the 6Pul units and was reused by them during World War II when the Pullman car was stored, but this stock was different from the 4Cor units.

British Rail Class 405

The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designation Sub to the wide variety of electric multiple units that were used on inner-suburban workings in the South London area. Originally these units were formed as three-car units, but in the 1940s, all surviving units were increased to four cars by the addition of an 'Augmentation' trailer. New four-car units were also built at this time, and these survived in passenger use until late 1983, by which time British Rail had allocated to them TOPS Class 405.

British Rail Class 411

The British Rail Class 411 (or 4 Cep) electrical multiple units were built at Eastleigh works from 1956-63 for the newly electrified main lines in Kent. These units were based on the earlier Southern Railway 4Cor design, built in 1937.

British Rail Class 413

The British Rail Class 413 (or 4Cap) units were formed in 1982 by permanently coupling two Class 414 2Hap units together. The cabs in the centre of the unit were decommissioned, thus reducing the weight of the units.

Logical disk

A logical disk is a concept from computing. Logical disks provide a certain amount of space to store data. Unlike real (called "physical") hard disks that can be touched, logical disks can take this storage space from different locations.

Common locations where this can be taken from:

The disk is described as "logical" because it does not actually exist as a single physical entity in its own right. 

When IBM first released the magnetic disk drive in the 1956 (IBM 305) a single drive would be directly attached to the using system, with each disk managed as a single entity. As the development of drives continued, it became apparent that reliability was a problem and systems using RAID technology evolved. This means that more than one physical disks are "RAID-ed" together to produce a single logical disk. 

In a modern home PC environment, disk drives now provide hundreds of gigabytes of storage capacity which can be impractical to use as a single entity. Therefore most systems have their drives partitioned into multiple "logical drives".

In most modern business IT environments, some form of a Storage area network will exist. Here, many storage devices are connected to many host server devices in a network. A single RAID array may provide some capacity to one server, and some capacity to another. Therefore logical disks are used to partition the available capacity and provide the amount of storage needed by each host from a common pool of logical disks.

British Rail Class 414

The British Rail Class 414 (or 2Hap) electric multiple units were built between 1956 and 1963.

British Rail Class 415

British Rail Class 415 (or 4EPB) was a suburban 750V DC third rail electric multiple unit commissioned by the Southern Region of British Railways. Built between 1951 and 1957, it became the most numerous class on the region after the withdrawal of the 4Subs. The final trains were withdrawn in the 1990s, replaced by Class 455, 456, 465 and 466

British Rail Class 416

The British Rail Class 416 (or 2EPB) electric multiple units were built between 1953 and 1956. They were intended for inner suburban passenger services on London's Southern Electric network.

British Rail Class 418

British Rail Class 418 (or 2Sap) was a class of electrical multiple unit commissioned by British Railways Southern Region. in England. The units were formed in the 1970s by simply declassifying the first class accommodation in selected 2Hap units. They were employed on inner suburban routes such as the Hounslow Loop.

British Rail Class 421

The British Rail Class 421 (or 4Cig) electrical multiple units were built at BR York Works from 1964-1972. Units were built in two batches, and were initially introduced on services on the Brighton Main Line. Later units were introduced on services to Portsmouth. These units replaced older Southern Railway-designed units, such as the 5Bel "Brighton Belle" units, and 4Cor units. These trains were known commonly as "slam-doors".

British Rail Class 423

The British Rail Class 423 (or 4Vep ) electrical multiple units were built by BR at York Works from 1967 to 1974, although the MBSOs and TSOs of the first 20, 7701-7720, were constructed at Derby Works. They feature manually opening doors next to every seating row. They were mostly found working outer suburban services in South London, and rural services in Kent and Sussex, up to 2005 when they were finally replaced by Electrostar and Desiro units.

British Rail Class 424

The British Rail Class 424 "Networker Classic" electric multiple unit (EMU) was built in 1997 by ADtranz at Derby. It was a prototype vehicle rebuilt from a Class 421 driving trailer vehicle.

Always (Sum 41 song)

"Always" is a single by Sum 41, released on their greatest-hits album "". It is the only new song on the record, recorded especially for this release, and was released as a radio single on December 9, 2008.<br> 
Although the album was released on November 26, 2008, the song was released to the public for free listening on the Universal Japan website on November 11, 2008. 
"Always" is not a typical Sum 41 song. It switches tempos back and forth during the whole song, from an acoustic slow intro to an up-tempo verse and chorus, up until a quiet piano break, again into an up-tempo chorus, and back to a totally stripped acoustic slow break from the whole tempo of the song. The song features a prominent use of piano and acoustic guitar, and has a much heavier sound than the one present on the band's last album "Underclass Hero". 
Like the band's last effort, "Underclass Hero", the song was totally produced, mixed and engineered by lead singer Deryck Whibley himself.

British Rail Class 432

The British Rail 4-REP electric multiple units were built by BR at York Works from 1966-1967 and 1974. The units were built to power the 4-TC trailer units on services on the South Western Main Line. Fifteen four-car units were built. The motor coaches were new build, but the trailers were converted from Mk1 hauled stock. They were initially classified as Class 441 and numbered 3001-3015. This was later changed to Class 430, under which they spent the majority of their working lives. Shortly before withdrawal they were reclassified Class 432 and the units were renumbered to 2001-2015.

British Rail Class 438

The British Rail 4-TC multiple units were unpowered fixed formation 4 carriage sets (fitted with driving cabs at each end) converted by BR at York Works from locomotive-hauled Mark 1 carriages in 1966-1967 and 1974. The units built on experience gained from the prototype 6TC unit. They were initially classified as Class 442 and numbered in the 300 and 400 series. This was later changed to Class 491, under which they spent the majority of their working lives. Shortly before withdrawal they were reclassified Class 438 and the units were renumbered to 8001-8034.

British Rail Class 442

The British Rail Class 442 "Wessex Electric" (or 5WES) electrical multiple units, were introduced in 1988 on the South Western Main Line from London Waterloo to Southampton Central, Bournemouth, Poole and Weymouth. Twenty-four of these 5-car units were built between 1988 and 1989 by BREL at their Derby works. Their introduction coincided with the completion of electrification from Bournemouth to Weymouth. The entire fleet was operated by South West Trains up until February 2007, when the Class 442 services were replaced.

British Rail Class 444

The British Rail Class 444 (or 5Des) "Desiro" electrical multiple units were built by Siemens AG from 2002-04. Forty-five of these units were built for express services for South West Trains. The "Desiro" family also includes units of Classes 350, 360 and 450.

British Rail Classes 445 and 446

The PEP Stock were prototype electric multiple units used on British Rail's Southern Region during the early 1970s. They were forerunners of the BR "Second Generation" electric multiple unit fleet. Three units were built, one two-car unit (2001), and two four-car units (4001/4002). Under TOPS, they were allocated Classes 445 (4PEP) and 446 (2PEP).

Notes

Ctenophore

The phylum Ctenophora, the comb jellies, is a phylum of marine invertebrates. They are part of the plankton, and there are also pelagic species. The phylum includes the sea gooseberry ("Pleurobrachia pileus") and Venus' girdle ("Cestum veneris").

The phylum was grouped with Cnidaria (jellyfish) in the former Coelenterata phylum. Ctenophores are the most basal known type of animals. 

Even though they look like jellyfish, they are zoologically not related to them. They lack the characteristic nematocysts (stinging cells), but have "colloblasts", sticky cells that snare small victims. They have eight rows of cilia which look like the teeth of a comb, hence Ctenophore = comb-bearer. Ctenophores have connective tissues and a nervous
system. There are about 150 described species of ctenophora spread throughout the world's oceans, from shallow estuarine waters to the deep sea. 

Although there are a few benthic species, most are gelatinous zooplankton and form a considerable proportion of the entire planktonic biomass worldwide. A few species, such as the sea gooseberry, native to the North Sea, have reached such high populations that they clog fishermen's nets, while of other species only a few examples are known. The fragile makeup of ctenophores makes research into their way of life extremely difficult. For this reason their lifespan is not known, but ctenophores begin to reproduce at an early age.

Many planktonic ctenophores produce a rainbow effect, which is not caused by bioluminescence but by "diffraction", the scattering of light, as the cilia on the combs beat. Most species are also bioluminescent, but the light is usually blue or green and can only been seen in darkness. However some groups appear incapable of bioluminescence.

Croats

Croats () are a South Slavic ethnic group mostly living in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and nearby countries. There are around 5 million Croats living in the southern Central Europe region, along the east bank of the Adriatic Sea and an estimated 9 million throughout the world. Large Croat communities exist in a number of countries, including Chile, the United States, Argentina, Australia, Germany, New Zealand and South Africa. Croats are noted for their unique culture, which comes from their location on the edge of the Western world which subjected them to various non European influences. The Croats are predominantly Catholic and their language is Croatian.


Poles

The Polish people, or Poles (, singular "Polak") are a Slavic nation and ethnic group native to Poland, they are bounded by the Polish language, which belongs to the Lechitic subgroup of west slavic languages of Central Europe, living mainly in Poland. Their religion is mainly Roman Catholic. They use modified Latin alphabet.

There are about 60 million Poles in the world. Besides Poland, many live in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Canada, France, the United Kingdom, Ukraine and elsewhere.

The most famous Poles are Pope John Paul II, Maria Skłodowska-Curie, Nicolaus Copernicus and Lech Wałęsa.

Polish surnames often end with "-ski", "-ska", "-cki" or "-cka".

The most popular Polish surnames are Nowak and Kowalski.

Histories (Herodotus)

The Histories of Herodotus of Halicarnassus is considered the first work of history in Western literature. Written about 440 BC in the Ionic dialect of classical Greek, "The Histories" tells the story of the Greco-Persian Wars between the Achaemenid Empire and the Greek city-states in the 5th century BC.

Thracians

The ancient Thracians were a group of Indo-European tribes who spoke the Thracian language - a rare branch of the Indo-European language family. Those peoples lived in Thrace: the eastern, central and southern part of the Balkan peninsula, and the adjacent parts of Eastern Europe. The Pomak claimed to be descendants of this old Trachians. Today People from Thrace, no matter if they are Turks, Bulgarians, Greeks, Pomak or Xoraxane Roma, said simple we are Thracians.

British Rail Class 458

The South Western Railway Class 458 (or 4JOP) electrical multiple units were built by Alstom at Washwood Heath between 1998 and 2000. These units are part of Alstom's "Juniper" family of units, which also includes Classes 334 and 460.

British Rail Class 460

The British Rail Class 460 (or 8Gat) electrical multiple units were built by Alstom at Washwood Heath between 1999 and 2001. These units were part of Alstom's "Juniper" family of units, which also includes Classes 334 and 458.

All have since been converted to Class 458/5 units (other than four surplus driving vehicles used as spares donors) for operation by South Western Railway.

Domitian

Domitian (Titus Flavius Domitianus, 24 October 51 – 18 September 96) was a Roman emperor who reigned from 14 September 81 until his death in AD 96.

Domitian was the last emperor of the Flavian dynasty, which ruled the Roman Empire between 69 and 96, This included the reigns of Domitian's father Vespasian (69–79), his elder brother Titus (79–81), and that of Domitian himself.

When Titus died (he was struck down by a fatal illness in 81), the next day Domitian was declared emperor by the Praetorian Guard. This started a reign which lasted fifteen years – longer than any man who ruled since Tiberius.

As emperor, Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the Roman coinage. He expanded the border defenses of the empire, and started a massive building program to restore the damaged city of Rome.

Significant wars were fought in Britain, where his general Agricola attempted to conquer Scotland, and in Dacia, where Domitian was unable to win a decisive victory against king Decebalus.

Domitian's rule was totalitarian. He saw himself as the new Augustus, as an enlightened despot destined to guide the Roman Empire into a new age. Religious, military, and cultural propaganda fostered a cult of personality. By nominating himself perpetual censor, he sought to control public and private morals. As a consequence, Domitian was popular with the people and army but considered a tyrant by members of the Roman Senate.

Domitian's reign came to an end in 96 when he was assassinated by court officials. The same day, he was succeeded by his advisor Nerva. After his death, Domitian's memory was condemned to oblivion by the Roman Senate, while senatorial authors such as Tacitus, Pliny the Younger and Suetonius published histories showing Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant.

Modern history has rejected these views. Now we see Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat, whose cultural, economic and political program provided the foundation of the peaceful second century.

British Rail Class 465

The British Rail Class 465 "Networker" electric multiple units were built by Metro Cammell and BREL between 1991 and 1993, and by ABB Rail between 1993 and 1994. They were brought into service from 1991 onwards. They are mostly used on suburban routes serving the South East of England, now operated by Southeastern.

He reigned in 1881 in the aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 . He died in October 1914 during World War 1 just after Austria-Hungary and Germany declared war on Serbia , Russia and France in August 1914


British Rail Class 483

The British Rail Class 483 electrical multiple units were originally built by Metro-Cammell as 1938 tube stock units for London Underground. They were extensively refurbished between 1989 and 1992 by Eastleigh Works, for use on services on the Isle of Wight's Island Line. This was despite having already worked for nearly fifty years on the London Underground. The units replaced the even older and life-expired Class 485 and Class 486 units, which were introduced in 1967, but were originally built as 'Standard' stock units for the London Electric Railway in 1923.


Pechenegs

The Pechenegs or Patzinaks (, , or , /in Hungarian diplomas) were a semi-nomadic Turkic people of the Central Asian steppes speaking the Pecheneg language which belonged to the Turkic language family. In 1766 Pechenegs are mentioned in Pécs and Surroundings.

Uzès

First Bulgarian Empire

The First Bulgarian Empire (Church Slavonic: ц︢рьство бл︢гарское, "ts'rstvo bl'garskoe") was a medieval Bulgarian state founded in AD 632 in the lands near the Danube Delta and which disintegrated in AD 1185 after its annexation to the Byzantine Empire.

Basarab I of Wallachia

Basarab I (c. 1310/1319–1352) was an early ruler of the principality of Wallachia from perhaps as early as 1310 until 1352. He is sometimes referred to as "Întemeietorul" ("The Founder"), given his role in the creation of the state, together with his position as common ancestor of rulers in the Basarab dynasty.

Dragoş

Dragoş ("Drágfi of Béltek") was a Maramureş Voivode ruling over the lands of what was to become Moldavia (between 1351 and 1353). He left Maramureş by orders from the Hungarian King Louis I, in order to establish a defense line against the Golden Horde. He was succeeded by his son, Sas ("Szász" or "Sas of Béltek") (ruled 1354-1358).

High Middle Ages

The High Middle Ages was the part of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1299). Before the High Middle Ages came the Early Middle Ages (from the 5th century to approximately AD 1000). After the High Middle Ages came the Late Middle Ages (about AD 1300–1500).

Kingdom of Hungary

The Kingdom of Hungary (Hungarian: "Magyar Királyság"), sometimes just Hungary, was a monarchy in Central Europe that existed for nearly a thousand years between 1000 and 1918. It came back during the Interwar period from 1920 to 1944 as a regency. It was created when Stephen I of Hungary was crowned in Esztergom in the year 1000. The first monarchy collapsed in 1918 because of the First World War, and the regency was liberated by the Soviet Union in 1944 during the end of the Second World War.

In the Middle Ages, the Kingdom of Hungary was one of the most powerful monarchies. It had many wars with the Ottoman Empire, usually because of the Balkans. It had an important role in both World Wars. 

Principality of Transylvania (1571–1711)

The Principality of Transylvania was a semi-independent state. It was ruled by mostly Calvinist Hungarian princes. The Principality existed as a semi-independent state from 1571 to 1711. It was a part of the Habsburg Monarchy / Austrian Empire from 1711 to 1867.

British Rail Classes 485 and 486

The British Rail Class 485 (or 4Vec) and British Rail Class 486 (or 3Tis) electrical multiple units were originally built for the London Electric Railway from 1923-31 as their 'Standard' tube stock. They were purchased by British Rail in 1967 and transported to the Isle of Wight to work 'mainline' services on the newly electrified Ryde to Shanklin line. At the time the units had already worked for over forty years on the London Underground, but their introduction allowed the final steam locomotives on the line to be withdrawn.

Suzerainty

Suzerainty (American accent: soo-zer-en-tee) happens when a country X has its own government but cannot act independently because of a more powerful country Y. This more powerful country Y is called the suzerain and can usually control the foreign relations of X (how X interacts with other countries).

It differs from sovereignty in that the tributary still has limited control of its own stuff and internal country affairs.

A suzerain can also mean a feudal lord. Vassals must pay tribute to the feudal lord.

The term suzerainty originally described the relationship between the Ottoman Empire and its surrounding regions including:


China historically had suzerainty over Mongolia, Korea.


British Rail Class 487

The British Rail Class 487 electric multiple units were built by English Electric in 1940, for use on the Waterloo & City Line.

British Rail Class 489

The British Rail Class 489 (or GLV) is a type of electrical multiple unit, specially converted for use on Gatwick Express trains, from London Victoria to Gatwick Airport.

Second-class citizen

A second-class citizen is a person who is discriminated by their country, even though they are a citizen or legal resident.

Second-class citizenry is usually seen as a violation of human rights. African-Americans who lived in the United States during segregation, Indian natives during British rule in India, and black Africans who lived in South Africa under apartheid, were often described in this way. Other groups of people that have been or still are being treated as second class citizens are the Dalit of India, and Arab Christians.


British Rail Class 499

British Rail allocated Class 499 to a fleet of six luggage vans used in electric multiple unit formations on boat train services between London and Dover. They were allocated Southern Region class TLV (meaning Trailer Luggage Van).

British Rail Class 505

British Railways Class 505 were 1,500 V DC electric multiple units (EMUs) introduced in 1931 by the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway (MSJAR). Although assigned to TOPS Class 505 by British Railways, these units were withdrawn before the TOPS numbering system came into common use for multiple units, and the Class 505 designation is very rarely used.

Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen

The House of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen is the cadet branch of the senior Swabian branch of the Hohenzollern dynasty, less known than the Franconian branch which became Burgraves of Nuremberg and later ruled Brandenburg-Prussia and the German Empire. The state which the cadet branch ruled was the County of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (), which later became a principality ("Fürstentum Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen").

British Rail Class 506

The British Rail Class 506 was a 3 carriage electric multiple unit (EMU) built for local services between Manchester, Glossop and Hadfield on the Woodhead Line. The 8 units were introduced in 1954. They had air-operated sliding doors. The EMUs had a single diamond-shaped pantograph, mounted over the driver's cab and adjacent guard's compartment at the outer end of one of the driving carriages (unlike other British EMUs, where the pantograph is mounted over one of the middle carriages).

British Rail Class 507

British Rail Class 507 electric multiple units were built by BREL at York works from 1978 to 1979. They were the third variety of British Rail's then-standard 1972 design for suburban EMUs, which eventually encompassed 755 vehicles and five Classes (Class 313/314/315/507/508). The 507s were the first variant to be 750V DC third rail only. They have worked on the Merseyrail network from new, and continue to do so, now refurbished by Alstom's Eastleigh Works.


British Rail Class 508

The British Rail Class 508 electric multiple units ("EMUs") were built by BREL at York works in 1979-80. They were the fourth variety of BR's then-standard 1972 design for suburban EMUs, eventually encompassing 755 vehicles and five classes (313/314/315/507/508). They have mostly worked on the Merseyrail network since 1983, and continue to do so, now refurbished by Alstom's Eastleigh Works.


Iași

Iaşi is a city in the northeastern part of Romania. It is the second largest city in Romania as of the year 2007. Iaşi used to be the capital of Moldavia.

Alexandru Lăpuşneanu changed the capital of Moldavia from Suceava to Iaşi in 1564. One of the first churches to be built in Moldavia was built by the Greek adventurer Prince Ioan Iacob Heraclid.

The Tatars burned the city down in 1513. The Ottoman Empire also burned the city down in 1538 and people from the Imperial Russian army did so again in 1686. The plague spread throughout the city in 1734.

The Russo-Turkish War of 1787 was stopped when the Peace of Iaşi happened. Alexander Ypsilanti and the Filiki Eteria came into the city and took it in 1822.

Iaşi was the capital of Moldavia from 1568 to 1859. When World War I happened, Iaşi became the capital of Romania. This happened when the Central Powers took Bucharest on 6 December 1916. Bucharest became the capital again when Imperial Germany was defeated.

Iaşi can be found on the Bahlui River, which is a tributary of the Jijia. Forests and uplands are very common. These woods and hills include the monasteries of Cetăţuia, Frumoasa, and Galata. People have thought that Iaşi was built on seven hills (Cetăţuia, Galata, Copou-Aurora, Bucium-Păun, Şorogari, Repedea and Breazu in Romanian).

The population of Iaşi has changed a bit over the years:


The following are the sister cities of Iaşi:



British Rail Class AM1

Class AM1 was allocated to the prototype AC electric multiple units, converted from fourth-rail DC electric stock in 1952 and used on the Lancaster/Morecambe/Heysham route. This route had been electrified by the Midland Railway at 6.6 kV, 25 Hz AC, but the frequency was changed to 50 Hz in 1953 to test the prototype AM1 stock.

Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)

The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 had its origins in a rise in nationalism in the Balkans as well as in the Russian Empire's goal of recovering territorial losses that it had suffered because of the Crimean War. Tsar Alexander II was fighting against the Ottoman Empire led by Abdul Hamid II .


Kingdom of Romania

The Kingdom of Romania (or 'Romania' after 1969) was a constitutional monarchy which existed between 13 March 1881 and 30 December 1947, specified by the First (in 1866), and respectively, the Second Constitution of Roumania. Thus, the Kingdom of Romania began with the reign of King Carol I of Romania and later replaced by Michael I of Romania . It's Prime minister was Ion Antonescu who was prime minister from 1940-1944 . He was later executed in 1946 2 year's after the defeat of Nazi Germany, Italy, Hungary, Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria and Japan, which were the Countries in the Axis Powers who were defeated in 1945.

From 1859 to 1877, Romania evolved from a personal union of two vassal principalities (Moldavia and Wallachia) to a full-fledged independent kingdom. During 1918-20, at the end of World War I, Transylvania, Eastern Moldavia (Bessarabia), and Bukovina were united with the Kingdom of Romania. In 1940, Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, Northern Transylvania and Southern Dobruja were ceded to the Soviet Union, Hungary and Bulgaria. In 1947 the last king was compelled to abdicate from throne. Socialist republic ruled by the Romanian Communist Party replaced the monarchy after Joseph Stalin occupied Romania in 1945 .

Treaty of Trianon

The Treaty of Trianon is the peace treaty signed in 1920 between the Allies and Hungary. 

Hungary lost World War I and so the treaty gave about two thirds of its land and one third of its population to neighboring countries, like Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. Under the principle of self-determination the majority of the people in the lost territories were something other than Hungarian. The partition brought irredentism, since many people in the lost lands were Hungarian and wanted to continue being part of Hungary. Hundreds of thousands of people from the lost territories sought refuge in Hungary. 

Also, the treaty forced Hungary to pay reparations and to limit the size of its army. Meanwhile, France helped its allies the Romanians to strengthen their army and defend their new territory of Transylvania.


Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye

The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye was signed on 10 September 1919 by the winning Allies and the new Republic of Austria on the other. Austria lost large amounts of territory to the Allies after it lost World War I.

Like the Treaty of Versailles with Germany, the treaty contained the Covenant of the League of Nations and so the United States did not ratify either of them.

Treaty of Paris (1920)

The 1920 Treaty of Paris was an act signed by Romania and the Principal Allied Powers of the time (France, United Kingdom, Italy and Japan) whose purpose was the recognition of Romanian sovereignty over Bessarabia. The treaty however never came into force because Japan failed to ratify it.

Bessarabia

Bessarabia is the word for the area in Eastern Europe between Romania and Ukraine. It shares borders with Dniester River on the east and the Prut River on the west. 

During the 19th century it was sometimes part of Romania and sometimes in the Russian Empire. It was again part of Romania most of the first half of the 20th century. The Soviet Union occupied the region after 1944. Today, most areas of Bessarabia belong to the Republic of Moldova.

Bukovina

Bukovina is a historical region in both Romania and Ukraine. It can be found by the northeastern Carpathian Mountains.

Dobruja

Dobruja or Dobrudja (; or "Dobrudža"; , ; ) is a region between Bulgaria and Romania. It is be found between the Danube and the Black Sea. It is divided between Northern Dobruja in Romania and Southern Dobruja in Bulgaria. 

The Romanian part of Dobruja, Dobrogea, is made up of the counties of Constanţa and Tulcea. The Bulgarian part of Dobruja, Dobrudzha, is made up of the provinces of Dobrich and Silistra.

Major cities in Dobruja include Constanța, Tulcea, Medgidia and Mangalia in the Romanian part and Dobrich and Silistra in the Bulgarian part.

Dobruja is a mainly hilly area except for the marshy Danube Delta. It has an average altitude of about 200–300  metres. Its highest point is the Țuțuiatu (Greci) Peak in the Măcin Mountains, with a height of 467 m. The Romanian part of Dobruja is covered mostly by the Dobruja Plateau. The Bulgarian part has the Ludogorie Plateau. Lake Razelm is one of the most important lakes in Northern Dobruja. Dobruja has a continental climate.

Dobruja is a windy region known for its windmills. There is wind during about 85–90% of all days. It usually comes from the north or northeast. The average wind speed is about twice higher than the average in Bulgaria.

LNER electric units

In 1937 the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) ordered a fleet of articulated electric multiple unit (EMU) passenger trains for use on the Tyneside Electric lines, which linked the English city of Newcastle upon Tyne with the coast at North Shields and South Shields. The order also included some single-unit motor parcel vans and motor luggage vans. 

România Mare

România Mare, translated from Romanian can mean:

LNWR electric units

During 1909-1922, the London and North Western Railway embarked on a large-scale project to electrify their whole London inner-suburban network, encompassing the lines from London Euston to Watford and the North London Railway from London Broad Street to Richmond. This also included branch lines such as Watford to Croxley Green (where a depot was built to house the electric units), and links to what was to become the London Underground network. For this reason, the lines were electrified using the fourth rail 630V DC system, the electricity being generated at the LNWR's own power station in Stonebridge Park. The first electric passenger trains ran in 1914, limited to the West London line route (Willesden to Earls Court), and full services over the whole network did not begin until 1922, work having been delayed by the First World War. The London, Midland and Scottish Railway extended the network in 1927 by electrifying the branch to Rickmansworth.

Golaniad

Golaniad was a protest in Bucharest, Romania. It started in April 1990.

LYR electric units

The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR) electrified urban railway lines in Liverpool and Manchester in order to improve the service offered against the competition being put up by new electric trams.

The line between Liverpool and Southport began using electric multiple units (EMUs) on 22 March 1904. Power was supplied from a third rail at 625 Volts direct current.

Connections were built with the Liverpool Overhead Railway (LOR) at Seaforth & Litherland railway station to a new station beside LOR's Seaforth Sands station. Also from the North Mersey Branch route to Aintree. From 2 July 1905 LOR trains began to run through to Seaforth and Litherland. In 1906 the L&YR electrified the line to Aintree.

Electrification to Ormskirk was completed in 1913.

From 1913 an experimental electric service operated between Bury and Holcombe Brook. The equipment was provided by Dick, Kerr & Co. of Preston, which was developing its products for export.
The system used was 3,500 Volts DC from overhead lines. In 1918 the line was converted to the 1,200 V DC system chosen for the Manchester to Bury line.

After the Holcombe Brook service, the L&YR decided to electrify the Manchester to Bury line. The system used was 1,200 V DC from a side-contact third rail. The purpose of this unusual arrangement was to prevent the service being affected by ice forming on the live rail. Sixty-six cars were built at Newton Heath works. The electrical equipment was supplied by Dick, Kerr & Co. The first public services ran on 17 April 1916,

Duchy of Courland and Semigallia

The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia was a duchy in the Baltic region. It existed from 1562 through 1795. It was a vassal state of Grand Duchy of Lithuania and later of Poland-Lithuania. It became independent in 1791, but was annexed by Russian Empire in 1795 during Third Partition of Poland. It was ruled by the dukes from the House of Kettlerwith the exception of Ernst Johann Biron and his son Peter von Biron.

It had its own empire. One of its colonies was modern day Trinidad and Tobago.

Bayeux

Bayeux is a commune. It is found in the region Basse-Normandie in the Calvados department in the Northwest of France.

The town is famous for its tapestry. It is one of the oldest complete tapestries in the world.

The inhabitants are called "Bajocasses" ou "Bayeusains". Bayeux is a "sous-préfecture" of the Calvados department.

Bayeux is the capital of "the Bessin" which was called Bajocasses before. Bessin was a province of France before the French Revolution. The name of the city comes from the Celtic tribe which lived in the Bajocasses region.

The Vikings distroyed the town in 890, but it was rebuilt by Bothon at the beginning of the 10th century. The bishop Hugues II, and his successor, Odon de Conteville (Guillaume le Conquérant's half brother) insisted the town needed a new cathedral. In 1077, a new one was built. However it is around that time that the town lost a lot of influence. Guillaume le Conquérant decided to make Caen his capital, in 1050. The Bayeux Tapestry was made around that time

The Renaissance didn't really mark the town. The most notable building from that period is the Saint-Patrice Church. It was built between 1544 and 1548.

Bayeux was the first city in France to be liberated after the Battle of Normandy. On 16 June 1944, General Charles de Gaulle made his first major speech in Bayeux. The buildings were not damaged much during the Battle of Normandy as the German forces were defending Caen at the same time.

The Bayeux War Cemetery is the largest British cemetery dating from the Second World War in France. There are 4648 graves: 3935 are British and 466 are German.

Bayeux is seven kilometres from the English Channel and the D-Day Landing Beaches. It is about 30 kilometres northwest of Caen. The town's elevation varies from 32 to 67 metres (with an average of 46 metres). The river Aure passes through it.

The table below gives the temperatures and precipitation for 2007 (Recorded at the "station Caen-Carpiquet") :

The table below gives the minimum and maximum temperatures for each month :

La Bayeux Train station is on the "Paris-Saint-Lazare>Cherbourg" line. The TER line is from Caen to Rennes.

The "Bybus" goes around the town and to the communes of Saint-Martin-des-Entrées and Saint-Vigor-le-Grand. There is one main line ("Chojnice / St-Martin-des-Entrées") and three minor one's toward the different districts. The "Bus verts" invented by the "Conseil général" is a way to get to the surrounding communes (lines 30, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74). 3000 parking spaces in the town center make it an easy place to park. Furthermore, most car parks are free. The "By-pass" is Bayeux's ring road. The first part was built after the Battle of Normandy by British soldiers. The roads in the town center were too narrow for the Tanks to get through. The "By-pass" used to be the "Route nationale 13" until a motorway was built (A13 autoroute).

The closest airport is in Caen (21 km away) and the closest ferry to England (32 km away) leaves in Ouistreham.


Bayeux is the fourth biggest town in Calvados by population. The three biggest are Caen, Hérouville-Saint-Clair and Lisieux.

SR Class 2Wim

2Wim was the designation given, by Southern Railway (SR), to a small fleet of electric multiple units, dedicated for use on the West Croydon to Wimbledon Line. None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class.

SR Class 4DD

Conceived by Oliver Bulleid for the Southern Railway's Dartford commuter route, the two 4DD electric multiple units were the only double-deck trains to run on the main line railway network in Britain. The upper-level seats were squeezed in between the lower-level seats to ensure that the overall height of the unit was within the clearances necessary to pass through tunnels and under bridges. The 4DD was somewhat unsuccessful because the upper level compartments were cramped and poorly ventilated (the upper level windows could not be opened due to tight clearance). The compartments were pressure-ventilated but the equipment proved to be troublesome. Also dwell times at stations were increased because of the increased number of passengers per door. To obtain the extra seating capacity that was being sought, it was instead decided to lengthen trains from eight cars to ten.

Network SouthEast

Network SouthEast (NSE) was one of three passenger sectors of British Rail created in 1982. NSE principally operated commuter trains in the London area and inter-urban services in densely populated South East England. Before 1986, the sector was known as London & South Eastern.

After privatisation, NSE was divided up into several franchises:

SR Class 4Lav

The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designation 4Lav to the electric multiple units built to work the semi-fast services on the route between London and Brighton. None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class.

SR Class 6Pul

The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designations 6Pul, 6Cit and 6Pan to electric multiple units built to work the routes between London and Brighton, West Worthing and Eastbourne. None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class number. The 6Pul units were designated 6Cor until 1935 (the Cor designation was later used for 4Cor units).

British Rail Mark 3

British Rail's third fundamental design of carriage was designated Mark 3, and was introduced in 1976 primarily for use on the High Speed Train (HST). The coaches were also used as conventional loco-hauled stock as part of the West Coast Main Line (WCML) northern electrification scheme in the mid 1970s, designated Mark 3A and 3B. The final batch was built in 1988, but Mark 3-based multiple units continued to be built until the early 1990s.


Desiro

Desiro is the brand name for a design of modular train manufactured by Siemens of Germany.

The Desiro can be made as a diesel or electric multiple unit (DMU or EMU). It is normally made as two and three-car trainsets. Although there are many differences between single trains, the basic body design is the same. These trains are mostly used for regional services, and belong to a new generation of light, modular trains which have become common in many European countries. They are sometimes thought as light regional railcars. They are mostly cheap to make and work. Their fast acceleration makes them good for services with short intervals between stations. However, they are sometimes complained by people for their poor passenger comfort.

In Austria, the ÖBB (Austrian Federal Railways) is using about 60 diesel-powered Desiro trains called "ÖBB 5022". These are based on the Class 642 used by Deutsche Bahn, but have added more safety stuff.

In 2005 and 2006, in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian State Railways begin working Desiro trains as part of a €67-million deal with Siemens AG for a total of 25 Diesel multiple units. As of 22 March 2006, 16 trains had been delivered, with many of them working on the Sofia-Kyustendil-Sofia line. Another €117-million deal for 25 EMUs has also been signed with Siemens AG. The EMUs were fitted out in Varna, where BDŽ and Siemens AG are thinking about making a joint venture company. The EMUs are classes 30 and 31 and are servicing traffic in the Sofia and Plovdiv areas.

In Denmark, DSB rented 12 Desiro trains since 2002. The train is mostly used between Odense and Svendborg and between Odense and Fredericia. On July 2, 2009 DSB signed a contract of eight trains from Siemens for Grenaabanen for delivery late 2010. Nordjyske Jernbaner used Desiro trains since 2004 on all its working rails. Today the company owns eight Desiro trains.

 Germany's Deutsche Bahn first showed two-car Desiro DMUs for local services in 2000. With a top speed of 120 km/h, these "Class 642" units are mostly used on branch lines and regional lines. Besides the 234 units bought by DB until 2007, many private German rail companies are also using Desiro DMUs.

The "Class 642" has two MAN diesel engines with an output of 275 or 315 kW each and hydro-mechanical transmission with retarders. It normally has 100 seats. When linked together with Scharfenberg couplers, up to three trainsets can be worked together. The Desiros are quite popular with most passengers, thanks to their good acceleration. Because they have often replaced push/pull trains, their shorter journey times, such as on the "Müglitzbahn", have made greater passenger numbers.

At first, DB was going to work together modern DMUs bought from different makers, but because of software trouble, this proved to be impossible. Therefore the "Class 642" can only be mechanically coupled with other DMUs like the "Class 643".

In Hungary, 31 diesel Desiros are in service with MÁV (counting 8 units from Greece), mostly as suburban trains on the secondary line between Budapest-Esztergom and Budapest - Lajosmizse and as an InterCity between Budapest and Baja. On weekends, the units also used as top inter-city trains from Budapest to Baja and Sátoraljaújhely and as fast trains from Budapest to Tapolca. During the summer months (when fewer units are used on the Budapest suburban routes) Desiros appear on some local train diagrams on the norther shore of the Lake Balaton.

The 57km KLIA Ekspres and KLIA Transit airport rail link uses the Desiro ET 425 M four-car Electric Multiple Units. There are 12 trainsets right now working in Malaysia.


These EMUs have a maximum commercial speed of 160 km/h.

Căile Ferate Române (CFR), Romania's national railway worker, is one of the largest users of the Siemens Desiro trainsets. CFR, which is right now undergoing modernisation, has bought many Desiro trainsets and uses them for all types of train: ""Regio"", ""InterRegio"" and ""InterCity"" inter-city services, but mostly on its ""InterRegio"" express trains. There was some criticism of the use of Desiros for CFR's long-distance services because they were thought to be uncomfortable. CFR has recently refitted them, and is now using Desiros mostly on its medium and short-distance routes.

In December 2009 Russian Railways ordered 38 Desiros for delivery in 2013 for use during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, with an option for a further 16 which would be mostly made in Russia.

Slovenian Railways works electric Desiro units that are made as DESIRO EMG 312 SR 31E. They are used as commuter stopping trains mostly on connections to and between Ljubljana and Maribor on the following lines:

SBB-CFF-FFS works double-decker (bilevel cars) EMU's. They are designated as class SBB RABe 514. They are used as commuter trains in Zürich, where 61 four-car sets have been working since 2006.

Nine 25 kV AC Desiro UK EMUs based on the Heathrow Connect Class 360/2 will be used for the Suvarnabhumi Airport Link which is right now under running test from the locomotive shop in Asoke to Suvarnabhumi Station under the airport.

Electrostar

Electrostar is the name given to a group of similar electric multiple unit passenger trains made by Bombardier Transportation, formerly ADtranz. Since the privatisation of British Rail, it has become the most common new EMU type in Britain, with different variants referred to as Class 357, Class 375, Class 376, Class 377, Class 378, Class 379, Class 387. They are most common on the high-volume commuter routes in South London and to the Sussex, Kent & South Essex coasts. It shares the same bodyshell and core structure as the Turbostar, which is in turn the most common post-privatisation diesel multiple unit family. All of the Electrostar fleet were assembled at Bombardier’s Derby works.

Cuckoo

The cuckoos are a family of near-passerine birds. They are the main part of the order called Cuculiformes. The family is famous for its "nest-parasite" members, but has a range of other types of bird. The cuckoo family, in addition to those species named as such, also includes the roadrunners, koels, malkohas, couas, coucals and anis.

The family is notable for its subfamily, the Cuculinae. Many of them have a unique kind of parasitism called brood parasitism. This means it lays its eggs in the nests of other kinds of birds, who then rear the baby cuckoo instead of their own.

The common cuckoo, "Cuculus canorus", (usually just called “cuckoo” in countries where it lives) is a spring migrant to Europe and northern Asia. It winters in Africa and southern Asia. It is a greyish bird with a slender body, long tail and strong legs. It looks a little bit like a small bird of prey when it flies. The male is dark grey above with a blackish brown tail, spotted and tipped with white and unevenly barred in black. The female is similar but a bit more reddish on the upper breast. It likes to eat hairy caterpillars. It is often found where woods border on to open land.

The cuckoo gets its names because the male Common Cuckoo sings two notes which sound like the word “cu – ckoo”. The female does not make this sound. She has a loud bubbling call.

The common cuckoo does not make a nest of its own, and they do not bring up their own young. Instead, the female lays her eggs in the nests of other birds. Each female cuckoo specialises in just one host species, and lays camouflaged eggs in that bird's nest. For example, a cuckoo which lays its eggs in reed warbler nests will lay eggs that look like those of a reed warbler.

The female cuckoo spends a lot of time watching the birds at the nest where she wants to lay an egg. She has to work out the exact time to go and lay her egg while the 'host' parents are not looking. If the cuckoo lays her egg in the nest before the other bird lays, the reed warbler will notice and knows it is not her egg, and so she will get rid of it. If the cuckoo lays her egg too late, when the reed warbler has finished laying, this will be noticed, too.

When the female cuckoo thinks it is the right moment she will fly down to the reed warblers' nest, pushes one reed warbler egg out of the nest, lays her egg and flies off. This only takes about 10 seconds. The reed warbler does not notice, and carries on looking after the eggs. When the cuckoo chick hatches it soon grows very fast. It pushes the other eggs or reed warbler chicks out of the nest. At 14 days old, it is about 3 times the size of the adult reed warblers. The chick has a huge mouth which it opens very wide. It also makes a very fast “cheeping” sound which sounds like a nest full of reed warbler chicks. This makes the parents behave as if they had a nest full of their own chicks.

About 56 of the Old World and 3 of the New World cuckoo species are brood parasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other birds. These species are obligate brood parasites, meaning that "they only reproduce in this fashion". The shells of the eggs of brood-parasites is thick. They have two distinct layers with an outer chalky layer that is believed to provide resistance to cracking when the eggs are dropped in the host nest.

Female parasitic cuckoos specialize and lay eggs which look like the eggs of their chosen host. This has been produced by natural selection, as some birds are able to distinguish cuckoo eggs from their own. This leads to those eggs least like the host's being thrown out of the nest.

Host species may take direct action to stop cuckoos laying eggs in their nest. Birds whose nests are at high risk of cuckoo-eggs often mob cuckoos and drive them out of the area.

Parasitic cuckoos are grouped into gentes: each gens specializes in a particular host species. This permits each gens to evolve a particular egg colouring. Thus, the species as a whole parasitizes a wide variety of hosts, but "each line of females specializes in a single host species".

Genes regulating egg colour are passed down only along the maternal line, no doubt on the sex chromosome. This allows females to lay mimetic eggs in the nest of their host species.

Females are thought to imprint on the host species which raised them; later they only parasitize nests of that species. Male cuckoos fertilize females of all lines, so gene flow takes place between the different maternal lines.

The detail and near-perfection of the cuckoo nest parasitism, and the defences of the host birds, are extraordinary. Many of the host species can spot and throw out almost perfect cuckoo eggs. This system is a fine example of an evolutionary arms race, a type of co-evolution. There are other birds which practice nest parasitism (such as the cowbirds) but these other systems are much less specialized.

The males and grey females in flight look a bit like a sparrowhawk. That may protect them from other birds' mobbing (Batesian mimicry). The advantage of the rufous-coloured females is not known. It may be that, being less common, they are less recognised by other bird species.

The cuckoo only stays in its summer location for about 10 weeks. In Britain, for example, it arrives in April and the adults start for Africa by the end of June or early July. They arrive in Africa (or Asia) in August.

They moult twice a year, changing feathers partially in summer, and completely in winter.

Southern Railway (UK)

The Southern Railway (SR), was one of the Big Four British railway companies from 1923 to 1948. It was established under the Railways Act 1921. The railway was formed by the amalgamation of smaller companies. The largest of these were the London and South Western Railway, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, and the South Eastern and Chatham Railway. 

The SR contained notable examples of civil engineering, linking London with the Channel ports, South West England and Kent. Construction of what was to become the Southern began in 1838 with the opening of the London and Southampton Railway, which was renamed the London and South Western Railway. 


Electric multiple unit

An electric multiple unit or EMU for short, is a type multiple unit train consisting of many carriages using electricity as the motive power. 

EMU trains are generally used on rapid transit lines, such as the Singapore MRT and the Melbourne rail network. As a result of this, EMU's usually lack features such as toilets, on-board food and comfy seats. 


List of British Rail modern traction locomotive classes

This page lists every locomotive allocated a TOPS classification and all modern traction (e.g. diesel, electric, gas turbine, petrol) stock used on the mainline network since 1948 (i.e. British Railways and post-privatisation).

The 1955 diesel locomotive classes are given in brackets where applicable.

A large number of different shunter types were purchased by British Rail and its predecessors, many of which were withdrawn prior to the introduction of TOPS. The tables below attempt to list the different types and the different classifications used to describe them as clearly as possible:

Shunter classes are listed by 1955 class, which puts TOPS classes in ascending order, and generally puts 1948 and 1962 classes in ascending order. Unclassed shunters are placed at the start of the table; TOPS class 07 has been placed so its 1962 class is in the logical place.



Locomotive class are listed by TOPS class. Locomotives for TOPS classes 24 and 26 have their original sub-classes shown, as each wholly comprised locomotives from a distinct 1962 class.


When British Rail implemented the TOPS system for managing their operating stock, part of their shipping fleet was incorporated into the system as Class 99, in order to circumvent some of the restrictions of the application software.

These were locomotives built and owned by private firms, but used by British Rail to test them.

A number of TOPS class numbers were allocated to proposed locomotives, both diesel and electric, which for many reasons were not proceeded with.

TOPS classes



List of British Rail electric multiple unit classes

This page lists every electric-powered multiple unit allocated a TOPS classification or used on the mainline network since 1948 (i.e. British Railways and post-privatisation). British Rail operated a wide variety of electric multiple units for use on electrified lines.

These use electrical switching devices (thyristors and transistors) and have electronic power control.

The Southern Railway and its successor, the Southern Region of British Rail, used three letter codes to classify their DC EMU fleets, as shown after the TOPS class numbers.

The 500 series classes were reserved for DC (third/fourth rail) EMUs not from the Southern Region. This included the DC (third/fourth rail) lines in North London, Merseyside and Greater Manchester. The DC electric network around Tyneside had been de-electrified by the time TOPS was introduced, and the stock withdrawn or transferred to the Southern Region.

TOPS classes
Pre-TOPS classes

This was a one-off unit, withdrawn before the introduction of TOPS.



List of British Rail departmental multiple unit classes

The 900 series classes were reserved for multiple units in departmental stock, most of which were converted from old passenger units. In broad terms, classes 930-935 were allocated to Southern Region multiple units (ex-200 and 400 series), 936 & 937 to other EMUs (ex-300 and 500 series) and 960 to other DMUs (ex-100 series). In recent years, this has been less rigidly adhered to.




The original use for the Southern Region (SR) classes are included in brackets; these designations have been less rigidly applied in recent years.



British United Traction

British United Traction (BUT) was a joint company owned by the Associated Equipment Company and Leyland Motors which produced railway equipment and trolleybuses.

British Rail Derby Lightweight

The British Rail Derby Lightweight diesel multiple units, were the first such trains to be built en-masse for British Railways. The units were built at BR's Derby Works from 1954 to 1955. The units were built in various formations, including two single car units, 12 power-twin 2-car units, 84 power-trailer 2-car units, and four 4-car units. Contemporaneous with these units was the unique Battery Electric Multiple Unit.

British Rail Metro-Cammell

In 1955, Metropolitan Cammell produced its first lightweight Diesel multiple units, the prototypes of what were to become British Rail's most successful and longest-lived "First Generation" Dmu the Class 101.

British Rail Railbuses

British Rail produced a variety of Railbuses as a means both of building new rolling stock cheaply, and to provide services on lightly-used lines economically.

GWR railcars

In 1933, the Great Western Railway introduced the first of what was to become a very successful series of railcars, which survived in regular use into the 1960s, when they were replaced with the new British Rail "first generation" type diesel multiple units.

LMS railcars

The London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) introduced a number of railcars to service between 1933 and 1939. They were mainly single units but one was a three-car articulated set. 

Pacer

Pacer trains were railbuses built by British Rail between 1980 and 1987. There were several classes of them: 140, 141, 142, 143 and 144. They were diesel multiple unit trains, meaning each carriage had its own diesel engine. Pacers were built as a stopgap because British Rail did not have enough normal trains at the time and could not get new ones quickly enough. They were not supposed to be used for more than 20 years, but it actually took nearly 35 years to replace them.

Most Pacer trains were put out of use in 2020. Two things finally made this happen. The first is that it is difficult for people with disabilities to climb onto Pacer trains. The Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations require that all public passenger trains must be made easy to use for disabled people by 2020 - but they made an exception for the Pacer trains until the end of 2020. Only one Pacer (the modernised 144e) follows this rule right now. The second is that the Transport Secretary made a decision in 2015 to retire the Pacers by 2020 for the then-new Northern service, arguing that it would be bad for the economy in the north to keep using "these uncomfortable and low-quality vehicles".

At the start of 2020, 138 Pacer units were still being used or stored by three National Rail operators: Northern Trains, Great Western Railway and Transport for Wales. Northern Trains retired its last Pacer unit on 27 November 2020, and so did Great Western Railway in December 2020. Transport for Wales kept using their Class 143s into the first part of 2021 until May 2021.

The Pacer series were made to keep building and running costs low, so all of the Pacer units use:

At the beginning of the 1980s British Rail (BR) needed to make new trains to replace its old first generation diesel multiple units (DMUs) which had been built between the mid-1950s and early-1960s. These old trains had helped replace steam and were popular with the public at the time. But BR did not get much money from the government, so could not get new trains that were just as good as the old ones. BR created two kinds of new second generation trains: the Sprinter series, for use on city and longer-distance services, and the Pacer series as cheap DMUs built using bus parts for short-distance countryside and branch line services. The Pacers were intended as a cheap stopgap solution to the shortage of trains, and were not supposed to be used for more than 20 years. BR set a challenge to several companies to design a cheap, lightweight train similar to railbuses. Since then, 165 Pacer trains (with 340 carriages in total) have been built. By 2015, some of these were over 30 years old.

They also tried to sell Pacers by showing them in the USA, Northern Ireland, Belgium, Sweden, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, but no one bought any there. However, Iran bought leftover Class 141 units, for use on suburban lines around Tehran until 2005.

The Pacer series was the outcome of an idea to try using bus parts to create a diesel multiple unit. The first prototype, known as LEV 1, was made by British Rail Research Division and Leyland Motors working together. It used a bus body that was mounted on a modified freight train underframe (HSFV1). In 1980 they also built a two-car prototype class 140 at British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL)'s Derby Litchurch Lane Works.

Then they built 20 more two-car units, forming the Class 141 fleet that was used mostly for suburban services in Yorkshire. They could carry 94 passengers in each set of two cars. Their two Leyland TL11 engines gave a total of , making for a top speed of . 

The 141s were built with Leyland National bus bodies that were so narrow that they could only be fitted with standard bus seats. The later Pacers had widened body panels to allow better seating.

The entire class got a technical upgrade in 1988 at the Hunslet-Barclay works in Kilmarnock. 

The units were withdrawn from British Rail in 1997. Many were sold to Islamic Republic of Iran Railways but have been withdrawn and are left in disused sidings in Iran. A few are preserved at museum sites.

The next and largest Pacer class was the Class 142. This again was built by Leyland and BREL, in 1985. The body was based on a Leyland National bus, built at Workington in Cumbria. Many fixtures and fittings of the Leyland National could be found on the units. The new class could carry more passengers: 120 passengers per two-car set. The same engines were used. 

The first sets were used on Devon and Cornwall branch lines and on commuter services in the north west. The units from Cornwall were eventually moved to Liverpool and the north east, so the Class 142s were often seen on services across the north of England. 

In the early 1990s, the 142s got more powerful Cummins engines, which gave a total power output of per two-car set. Several units were then changed for use on the Merseyside PTE City Line on Merseyrail in the Liverpool region, giving them dot-matrix route signs, better seating and Merseyrail PTE paintwork. 

When privatisation happened, the class 142s were taken over by Arriva Trains Northern and First North Western, and then by Northern Rail, Arriva Rail North, Northern Trains, Arriva Trains Wales and Transport for Wales. Eight Northern Rail units were withdrawn from service for a while and replaced by a series of British Rail Class 158s. First Great Western received 12 units on loan from Northern Rail from December 2007 to November 2011 (five units were returned to Northern in December 2008). This allowed most of its Class 158 fleet to be rebuilt as three-car sets.

Around the same time that the Class 142 was developed, another class of Pacer railbus was designed by Kilmarnock-based Hunslet-Barclay. These used a Walter Alexander bus body. They were given the number Class 143 and started being used in 1985. Its two 205 bhp engines gave a total output of and a top speed of . This class of Pacer originally had a capacity of 122 passengers. They were used in the North East before being transferred to Wales and the South West, and were moved over to Valley Lines and Wales & West control during privatisation. They then passed on to Arriva Trains Wales, Wessex Trains, First Great Western and Transport for Wales. The interiors were completely changed in 2000, when the Valley Lines service was introduced, with full back, coach-type seating installed throughout, along with improved fittings. This reduced seating capacity to 106 seats per set.

Then came a similar Class 144 unit, a Walter Alexander body on BREL underframe, which was introduced in 1987. A unit was formed of either a two-car set with 122 seats or a three-car set with a total capacity of 195 passengers and , but its top speed was still . The units were used in the North East, passing to Northern Spirit at privatisation, then to Arriva Trains Northern, Northern Rail, Arriva Rail North and now Northern Trains.

It has often been said that the Pacers are of poor quality. Instead of the usual bogies, Pacers use a basic four-wheel two-axle underframe. This often makes for a ride that is noisier and less comfortable than other trains, especially over points, and a loud squealing noise is heard around tight curves. Not having bogies also makes for a worse suspension and a bumpier ride; Pacers have been nicknamed "nodding donkeys" because of the trains' up-and-down motion on uneven track. The basic bench seating can also be uncomfortable. The early units, especially the s, were also very unreliable.

Pacers have only been used in certain areas of the north and south west of England and the south of Wales, but not in the richer London or south east England areas. This has also created bad feelings.

Safety worries were raised after the 1999 Winsford crash. A Virgin Trains Class 87 express train ran into an empty First North Western Class 142 Pacer, after the Pacer had fouled the main line at Winsford, Cheshire on the West Coast Main Line. The wire straps that held the body of the Pacer to its frame broke, separating the body from the frame and causing severe damage. The unit was written off. Twenty-seven passengers and crew were wounded, four badly. But all passenger injuries were on the other train, as the Class 142 was running empty at the time.

On the other hand, the Pacers were seen as a practical solution at a time when there was not a lot of money. They probably saved services on some rural lines that might not have been serviced by any trains at all if only more expensive trains had been available. They have also proved cheap to run, achieving a fuel economy of 10 miles to the gallon.

As of 2020, the oldest Pacers on the national network were nearly 35 years old. All were planned to be withdrawn and scrapped by December 2019 as they do not comply with Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations.

In July 2019, rollout of Northern's Class 195 CAF "Civity" units had begun on some routes. Because of this, refurbished Sprinters that no longer needed on those routes can be used to replace Pacers instead.

These units are built out of upcycled London Underground D78 Stock, built between 1978 and 1981, which were in service on the District line until 2017. To convert the old stock for mainline railway use, it will be necessary to re-use the aluminium bodyshells, traction motors and bogies from the D78 units and fit them out with new diesel engines and interiors. The D-Train units underwent acceptance testing in 2015 and Vivarail pitched them to train operating companies (TOCs), especially those bidding for the Northern franchise. While no orders were received from Northern, Transport for Wales will replace its Pacers with a combination of five D-Trains and trains taken over from other train operators, and other TOCs have ordered D-trains to replace other outdated trains: South Western Railway for the Isle of Wight's Island Line, and West Midlands Trains for the Marston Vale line

Porterbrook, which owns the Class 143 and Class 144 fleets, refurbished 144012 in 2014 to comply with the new legislation, dubbed the "144e Evolution" unit. However, no other units have been refurbished to this standard. 

Several "Pacers" have been preserved for further use on heritage railways. The National Railway Museum has preserved 142001. 

In May 2019, the government asked the public how to re-use the trains after withdrawal from service. One of the suggestions was re-using them as public spaces, such as village halls or cafes.

Sprinter (British Rail)

The Sprinter is a family of diesel multiple unit trains in use on the UK railway system. They were built in the 1980s and early 1990s by BREL, Metro Cammell and Leyland. All are based around a Cummins engine with Voith hydraulic transmission. Sprinters can be seen operating in almost every part of the UK, from rural branch lines to commuter expresses into major cities.

Turbostar

Turbostar is the name given to a series of diesel multiple units (DMU) built by Bombardier Transportation (previously ADtranz) at their Litchurch Lane Works in Derby, England. The Turbostar was the first new train type to be introduced after the privatisation of British Rail, and is the most common type of diesel multiple unit (its electrical variant, the Electrostar, is the most common electric multiple unit). The first units were ordered by Chiltern Railways in 1996 and were designated Class 168 (also known as "Clubman"). Since then the family has grown with the addition of the Class 170, Class 171, and (in development) the Class 172.

Alstom Coradia

Coradia is the name given to the range of multiple-unit inter-city and regional trains manufactured by Alstom. There are a number of variants of this series, used in several countries.

Bombardier Voyager family

The Voyager series is a group of high speed diesel electric multiple unit trains built by Bombardier Transportation in service on the UK railway network. The trains are among the most modern currently in operation, and are in service on many intercity routes around Great Britain. There are currently three types in service with 3TOCs (, East Midlands railway avanti and CrossCountry).

Diesel multiple unit

A diesel multiple unit or DMU is a multiple unit train consisting of multiple carriages powered by one or more on-board diesel engines. They may also be referred to as a railcar or railmotor, depending on country.

The diesel engine drives the train through a transmission system. The transmission system may be:


British Rail Janus

Janus and Taurus were two shunting locomotives by the Yorkshire Engine Company and loaned to British Railways for demonstrations. However, BR did not buy any production versions after testing. At least one other Yorkshire Engine Company locomotive was loaned to British Railways in the 1960s.

British Rail HS4000

HS4000, named "Kestrel", was a prototype high-powered mainline diesel locomotive built in 1968 by Brush Traction to demonstrate its wares to British Railways. The name came from Hawker Siddeley (the owner of Brush) 4000 hp (the power rating of its Sulzer engine).

British Rail GT3

GT3 was a prototype mainline gas turbine locomotive. It was built in 1961 by English Electric at their Vulcan Foundry in Newton-le-Willows to demonstrate its wares to British Railways. It was designed by Vulcan engineer J. O. P. Hughes and the project was started in the early 1950s. Externally, it resembled a steam tender locomotive. In the case of GT3, the tender carried diesel fuel.


British Rail DP2

DP2, meaning Diesel Prototype number 2, was a prototype Type 4 mainline diesel locomotive built in 1962 by English Electric at their Vulcan Foundry in Newton-le-Willows to demonstrate its wares to British Railways. As the Deltics were then in production, it was decided to produce the locomotive on the same production line; the bodyshell used for DP2 reputedly being the eighteenth made. While DP2 looked like a Class 55 locomotive in outline, there were many detail differences; particularly the large bodyside radiator vents at one end, and the single roof fan as opposed to the four symmetrically placed fans on the Deltics. These differences were the external effect of DP2 being totally different from the twin-engined Deltics internally, being the forerunner of the Class 50.

British Rail DP1

DP1, or Prototype Deltic is a demonstrator locomotive built by English Electric in 1955. This locomotive resulted in 22 similar locomotives being ordered by British Rail, which became their Class 55.

British Rail DHP1

DHP1, meaning Diesel Hydraulic Prototype number 1, was a prototype Type 3 mainline diesel locomotive built in 1965 by Clayton to demonstrate their wares to British Railways. It was designed for mixed traffic work, having steam heating facilities for working passenger trains. It was painted red, with the cab area above bonnet-level height painted cream.

British Rail D0260

D0260, named "Lion", was a prototype Type 4 mainline diesel locomotive built in 1962 by the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, in association with Sulzer and Associated Electrical Industries, at their Smethwick works in Birmingham to demonstrate their wares to British Railways. The locomotive’s number was derived from its works number, DEL260.

British Railways D0226

D0226 and D0227 were two prototype diesel shunting locomotives built in 1956 by English Electric at its Vulcan Foundry in Newton-le-Willows to demonstrate its wares to British Railways. They originally carried numbers D226 and D227, their Vulcan Foundry works numbers, but these were later amended to avoid clashing with the numbers of new Class 40 locomotives.

British Rail 18100

British Rail 18100 was a prototype main line gas turbine-electric locomotive built for British Railways in 1951. It was built by Metropolitan Vickers, Manchester. It was ordered by the Great Western Railway in the 1940s, but construction was delayed by World War II. It spent its working life on the Western Region of British Railways, operating express passenger services from London Paddington station.

It was rebuilt as an electric locomotive in 1958 and became British Rail Class 80. It was scrapped in 1973.

British Rail 18000

British Rail 18000 was a prototype mainline gas turbine-electric locomotive built for British Railways in 1949. It was built by Brown, Boveri & Cie. It was ordered by the Great Western Railway in 1940, but construction was delayed by World War II. It spent its working life on the Western Region of British Railways, operating express passenger services from London Paddington station.

The locomotive is preserved at Didcot Railway Centre.

LNER Class Y11

LNER Class Y11 was a class of petrol powered 0-4-0 locomotives built by Motor Rail & Tram Car Company Limited under their "Simplex" brand and introduced in the years 1919–1925 for the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). Their British Railways numbers were 15097–15099.

British Rail Class 97

British Rail reserved the TOPS Class 97 designation for departmental locomotives. These were used for special or engineering duties. They were therefore of several different classes, lumped together for numbering purposes. Some locomotives were converted from redundant engines, whilst others were purpose built. In 2008, Network Rail once again used Class 97 for signalling test locomotives (Class 97/3).

British Rail Class 97/6

The British Rail Class 97/6 0-6-0 diesel shunting locomotives were purpose-built for departmental duties by Ruston & Hornsby at Lincoln in 1953 (97650) or 1959 (97651-654). There are minor technical differences between 97650 and the 1959 batch.

British Rail Eastern Region departmental locomotives

In 1952, the Eastern Region of British Rail introduced its own series for departmental (non-revenue earning) vehicles, including locomotives. Numbers were allocated from 1 to 1000, with blocks of 100 numbers allocated to specific types of vehicle.

SR departmental locomotives

The Southern Railway numbered its departmental (non-revenue earning) stock, both locomotives and carriages in a series starting at 1S. The series was retained by the Southern Region of British Rail, but amended so that the numbers carried a 'DS' prefix instead of an 'S' suffix. This page lists the locomotives numbered in this series, including steam, diesel and electric locomotives.

British Rail departmental locomotives

Before the introduction of the Total Operations Processing System, Class 97 was issued to self-propelled locomotives in departmental (non-revenue earning) use, British Rail had such locomotives numbered in a variety of series, together with locomotives that were no longer self-propelled. See Also:

British Rail Class ES1

British Rail Class ES1 was a class of two electric locomotives commissioned by the North Eastern Railway in 1902. They were of steeplecab design.

British Rail Class EF1

The British Rail Class EF1 ("Electric Freight 1") was a class of electrically powered locomotives used by British Rail in England. They were used during the pre-TOPS period. They were also classified as British Rail Class EB1 for a short period of time, although only a single locomotive was completely modified to "EB1" condition.

British Rail Class EE1

British Rail Class EE1 was an electric locomotive commissioned by the North Eastern Railway in 1922. Ownership passed to the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923 and to British Railways in 1948.

British Rail Class EB1

The British Rail Class EB1 ("Electric Banking 1") was an electrically powered locomotive used by British Rail in England. It was used during the pre-TOPS period. The other NER electric locos built at the same time were classified as EB1 but were never modified, they later became British Rail Class EF1.

SNCF Class BB 22200

The BB 22200 is a class of electric locomotives in service with the French railways SNCF, built by Alsthom between 1976-1986. They are a polycurrent version (1500 CV direct current and 25 kV 50 Hz AC) of the BB 7200 and BB 15000 classes, with which it shares the exterior appearance. Thanks to this characteristic they can run in all French electrified lines.

Vossloh G1206

The Vossloh G1206 is a B'B' diesel hydraulic freight locomotive built by Vossloh and used by several mainland European railway operators. The design was created in the mid-1990s by Maschinenbau Kiel (MaK) for German coal supplier RAG Aktiengesellschaft (RAG AG) and is a follow-on to the "G1205" locomotive class built as SNCB Class 77. A cab is provided above one of the bogies, with walkways on both sides along the rest of the locomotive. Rated power is from either a MTU or Caterpillar engines, giving a top speed of .

British Rail Class 41 (HST)

The British Rail Class 41 was the original classification for the power cars of the prototype High Speed Train. However, the train was later re-classified as a diesel-electric multiple unit, and the whole set became Class 252. They were of Bo-Bo wheel arrangement.

British Rail Class 43 (Warship Class)

The British Rail Class 43 diesel-hydraulic locomotives were built by the North British Locomotive Company (NBL) from 1960 to 1962.

British Rail Class 43 (HST)

North Midland Railway

The North Midland Railway was a British railway company, which opened its line from Derby to Rotherham (Masborough) and Leeds in 1840.

Glasgow Corporation Tramways

Glasgow Corporation Tramways were formerly one of the largest urban tramway systems in Europe. Over 1000 municipally-owned trams served the city of Glasgow, Scotland. The system closed in 1962 and was the last city tramway in Great Britain (prior to the construction of new systems in the 1990s). 

Southampton Corporation Tramways 45

Southampton Corporation Tramways No. 45, or Southampton 45, is an open-top tramcar. It was built in 1903 by Hurst Nelson. At first it had a three window saloon, before being rebuilt by Southampton Corporation Tramways with a four window one. The tram looks out of proportion as it had to pass through the very low Bathgate Arch in the centre of Southampton. A normal sized tram would not have been able to have passed underneath the arch.

The tramcar operated from 1903 until the Southampton system closed in 1949. At an enthusiasts' tour of the system, the Museum Committee of the Light Railway Transport League bought the tram for £10. This price included a refurbished truck and a full repaint. This act began the entire preservation movement of British tramways.

After it had been purchased the tram travelled the country as there was not yet a museum set up that could store the tram. By 1955 the tram was being stored at Marton depot in Blackpool. It was soon given to the Tramway Museum Society (TMS) and moved to the National Motor Museum at Beaulieu, Hampshire. It was placed next to Newcastle 102, another preserved tramcar. Both of the trams were in an open-air display.

The tram moved to Crich Tramway Village in October 1960, and has been there ever since. It is in regular use during the summer months and is the museum's only operational open-top tramcar.

Acanthocephala

The Acanthocephala (Greek "akanthos", thorn + "kephale", head) are a group of parasitic worms. They are modified rotifers.

They may be known as "acanthocephales", "thorny-headed worms", or "spiny-headed worms". They have an evertable proboscis, armed with spines, which they use to pierce and hold the gut wall of the host. Acanthocephalans have no gut and absorb nutrients directly from the host’s gut. 

Acanthocephalans have complex life cycles, with various hosts, including invertebrates, fishes, amphibians, birds, and mammals. The juveniles are parasitic in crustaceans and insects. Adults live in the digestive tract of vertebrates, especially fish. About 1150 species have been described.

The Acanthocephala were thought to be a separate phylum. Recent genome analysis has shown that they are closely related to rotifers. Since all parasites are derived from free-living forms, the Acanthocephalans are modified rotifers. This is an example of molecular phylogenetics. In due course, spiny-headed worms will probably be placed in a taxonomic rank below phylum, such as sub-phylum or class.

Second Polish Republic

Second Polish Republic was name of Polish state from 1918 (end of WWI) through 1939 (start of WWII). When its borders were fixed in 1922 after several wars, it had borders with Czechoslovakia, Weimar Republic (Germany), Free City of Danzig, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Soviet Union. Józef Piłsudski was the leader during most of the state's existence.


The Second Polish Republic, in 1939, was invaded by the Greater German Reich and the U.S.S.R. after refusing to make territorial changes towards Germany. Poland was then fully occupied by both countries 39 days later. The government fled to the United Kingdom and became the Polish government-in-exile, while based in London. It continued it's existence in Poland as the Polish Underground State until 1945 when Poland was released but made a communist, soviet, satellite state. The pre-war government remained in exile until the collapse of Communism in 1990. Afterwards, it dissolved and handed it's roles over to the current Polish State.

Ze (Cyrillic)

Ze (З, з) is the eighth letter in the Cyrillic alphabet. It sounds like [z]. It looks like a "3" and can be mixed up with Э.

It came from the Greek letter zeta and corresponds to the Roman letter Z.


I (Cyrillic)

I (И, И̇, и, и̇) is the ninth letter in the Cyrillic alphabet. It sounds like [i] or [ee].
It looks like a backwards N. The lowercase и's italic looks like a "и". Its old name was "izhe".

It came from the Greek eta and stands for the Roman I.

There is another letter, the decimal I ("І", "і"), that sounds the same as И. Russian, Macedonian, Serbian and Bulgarian languages use only И; and Church Slavonic and Ukrainian uses both И and і. To tell the letters apart, И is sometimes called "octal I" because was eighth in the Cyrillic numeral system.

Storm drain

A storm drain, storm sewer (U.S.), stormwater drain (Australia and New Zealand) or surface water system (UK) is designed to drain extra rain and ground water from paved streets, parking lots, sidewalks, and roofs. Storm drains vary in design from small residential dry wells to large municipal systems. They are fed by street gutters on most motorways, freeways and other busy roads, as well as towns in areas which experience heavy rainfall, flooding and coastal towns which experience regular storms.

Jet stream

Jet streams are fast flowing, relatively narrow air currents found a little below the tropopause, the transition between the troposphere (where temperature decreases with height) and the stratosphere (where temperature increases with height). This is about above the surface of the Earth.

The camp was liberated on 15 April 1945 by British soldiers. Inside the camp, the British soldiers found 60,000 people, and 13,000 dead bodies lying on the ground, unburied. The scenes were horrific. They were described by the BBC's Richard Dimbleby, who was with the British soldiers:

Bumblebee bat

The bumblebee bat ("Craseonycteris thonglongyai"), also known as Kitti's hog-nosed bat, is an endangered species of bat. It is the only member of the family Craseonycteridae. It occurs in western Thailand and southeast Burma. It usually lives in limestone caves along rivers.

This is the smallest species of bat and one of the world's smallest mammals. It has a reddish-brown or grey coat, with a distinctive pig-like snout. Colonies vary in size, with an average of 100 individuals per cave. The bat feeds during short activity periods in the evening and dawn, foraging around nearby forest areas for insects. Female bat have only one offspring each year.

The bumblebee bat is about 29–33 millimetres (1.14–1.30 in) in length and 2 grams (0.07 oz) in mass). This is the reason for its common name "bumblebee bat". It is the smallest species of bat. The Etruscan shrew is lighter (1.2–2.7 g) (0.042-0.095 oz).

The bat has a distinctive swollen, pig-like snout with thin, vertical nostrils. Its ears are relatively large, while its eyes are small and mostly concealed by fur. Its teeth are typical of an insectivorous bat.

The wings are relatively large and darker in colour, with long tips that allow the bat to hover. Kitti's Hog-nosed Bat has no visible tail. There is a large web of skin between the hind legs which may help in flying and catching insects, although there are no tail bones to help control it in flight.

In Thailand, the bat is in a small region of Kanchanaburi Province, in the drainage basin of the Khwae Noi River.

Since the 2001 discovery of a single individual in Burma, at least nine separate sites have been identified. The Thai and Burmese populations are morphologically identical, but their echolocation calls are distinct. It is not known whether the two populations are reproductively isolated.

The bumblebee bat roosts in the caves of limestone hills, along rivers, within dry evergreen or deciduous forests. While many caves contain only 10 to 15 individuals, the average group size is 100, with a maximum of about 500. Individuals roost high on walls or roof domes, far apart from each other. Bats also undertake seasonal migration between caves.

The bat has a brief activity period, leaving its roost for only 30 minutes in the evening and 20 minutes at dawn. These short flights are easily interrupted by heavy rain or cold temperatures. During this period, the bat forages within fields of cassava and kapok or around the tops of bamboo clumps and teak trees, within one kilometre of the roosting site. The wings seem to be shaped for hovering flight, and the gut contents of specimens do include spiders and insects that are presumably gleaned off foliage. Nevertheless, most prey is probably caught in flight. Main staples of the bat's diet include small flies.

Late in the dry season (around April) of each year, females give birth to a single offspring. During feeding periods, the young either stays in the roost or remains attached to the mother at one of her two vestigial pubic nipples.

The bumblebee bat was discovered in 1974. It is the only living species in the family Craseonycteridae.

As of the species' most recent review in 1996, the bat is listed by the IUCN as endangered, with a downward population trend.

Currently, the most significant and long-term threat to the Thai population could be the annual burning of forest areas, which is most prevalent during the bat's breeding season. In addition, the proposed construction of a pipeline from Burma to Thailand may have a negative impact. Threats to the Burmese population are not well known.

In 2007, the bat was identified by the EDGE project (evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered) as one of its top 10 "focal species".

Etruscan shrew

The Etruscan shrew ("Suncus etruscus") is also known as the Etruscan pygmy shrew or the white-toothed pygmy shrew. It is the smallest known mammal by mass. The Bumblebee bat has a smaller skull. 

The smallest adults of this shrew weigh about 1.3 grams and are 36 mm (1.42 inches) long. This small mammal is 60 mm from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail; the tail is about 40 mm long. 

The shrew has a lifespan of 15 months. The Etruscan shrew lives in forests and brush areas between southern Asia and southern Europe. The shrew mostly eats insects.

Ballan, Victoria

Ballan is a small town in Victoria, Australia. It is a part of the Shire of Moorabool. Ballan is north west of Melbourne, on the Werribee River. In 2006 there were 1808 people living in Ballan. The Western Freeway goes past the town.

The first people to live in the Ballan area were the Aborigines, the Wautharong people. The area was rich in animals with kangaroos, kangaroo rats, bandicoots, dingos, and two sorts of native cat. Many of these animals had gone by the end of the 1800s, with Europen settlement.

The first European settlers came from Tasmania, landing near Geelong, Victoria, and working their way up the Moorabool River with their sheep flocks. Robert Von Steiglitz first came to the area in 1838. He named it after Ballan in Ireland. Other early settler names included Covvie, Stead, Wallace and Egerton.

There were fights between the Wautharong people and white farmers during settlement. Robert Von Steiglitz said stated in his diary:

... it may be questioned by some feather-bed philanthropist whether we had the right to take the country from the blacks but I believe the general rule is that if people cultivate or graze the land they have a claim to it. These creatures did neither ...
Gold was found in the area in 1851. A lot of people came to look for gold. This was part of the Victorian Gold Rush. The Ballan Hotel dates from the gold rush period in 1851. The town was an important staging point for coaches going to the Ballarat goldfields. The Post Office opened in September 1853 although there were two earlier offices in the area named Ballan.

Ballan’s first primary school started on 8 January 1855.

The first Mechanics' Institute in Ballan was built in 1861. The current Mechanics' Institute built on land bought in 1881. The facade (front) of the building was taken down and rebuilt in 1922. The building houses the library for the town town and a hall.

St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church in Ballan was opened in July 1866.

On 15 November 2003 a Sprinter train going to Ballarat was derailed (came off the tracks) between Ballan and Gordon hurting 61 people when it crashed into a car on a country railway crossing.

The town has an Australian Rules Football team playing in the Central Highlands Football League.
It also has two senior and three junior cricket teams in the Ballarat Cricket Association.

British Rail Class D3/3

British Rail Class D3/3 was a 0-6-0 shunting locomotive built by British Rail at their Derby Works in England. It was similar to the British Rail Class 08, except they were built with different engines and traction motors. They were all withdrawn and scrapped after only twelve years of service. 

British Rail Class D3/5

British Rail Class D3/5 was a shunting locomotive built by British Rail at their Darlington Works in England. It was a diesel powered locomotive in the pre-TOPS period and the class was numbered 13152–13166 (later renumbered D3152-D3166).

British Rail Class D3/6

Class D3/6 were diesel shunters built in 1935 by English Electric for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. They were the first of a new design of diesel shunters based on the English Electric 6K of 350 hp diesel engine. One demonstrator and ten production locomotives were built, numbered 7079 and 7069-7078 by the LMS. Three of these later became British Rail numbers 12000–12002 (previously 7074/76/79 respectively). The remainder were sold to the British War Department in 1940 and were shipped to France during World War II. Of these the first production locomotive, no. 7069, survived the war and was used in industrial service in France. It was later repatriated for preservation and is now based at the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway.

British Rail Class D3/7

British Railways Class D3/7 were diesel shunters built from May 1939 through to July 1942 by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway at their Derby Works. Like the earlier British Rail Class D3/6, they had the English Electric 6K diesel engine of . But a big change was having a "Jackshaft" type of connection between engine and wheels (like a diesel mechanical shunter). These were given LMS numbers 7080–7119. Ten were loaned to the War Department in 1941, and sold to the WD the following year. All ten survived the war; six were then sold to Egyptian Railways and four to Italian State Railways (Ferrovie dello Stato—FS). 

British Rail Class D3/9

British Rail Class D3/9 was a class of four locomotives built by the London and North Eastern Railway at their Doncaster Works in England. It was a diesel powered locomotive in the pre-TOPS period. 

British Rail Class D3/10

British Rail Class D3/10 was a locomotive commissioned by the Great Western Railway in England, and later taken over by British Railways. It was a diesel powered locomotive in the pre-TOPS period. 

British Rail Class D3/11

British Rail Class D3/11 was a locomotive commissioned by the Great Western Railway, but delivered to its successor British Rail in England. It was a diesel powered locomotive in the pre-TOPS period. 

British Rail Class D3/12

British Rail class D3/12 was a class of three diesel electric shunting trains built by the Southern Railway in 1937. They were numbered 1 to 3 in a separate list from the SR's steam-powered trains. They were later renumbered by British Railways 15201–15203. Later, twenty-six similar trains were built after nationalisation as British Rail Class 12.

British Rail Class D3/14

British Rail Class D3/14 was a diesel-electric locomotive built by the London and North Eastern Railway at its Doncaster Works. It had a Petter engine, and Brush Traction electricals. It was absorbed by British Railways on nationalisation, but was withdrawn in the pre-TOPS era.

British Rail Class D16/1

British Railways Class D16/1 or 10000 and 10001 were the first mainline diesel locomotives in Great Britain. They were built by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway at its Derby Works, using the EE16SVT 1600 hp diesel engine with electric transmission, in association with English Electric and the Vulcan Foundry, with whom the LMS had had a long working relationship. 

British Rail 10100

British Railways 10100 was an unusual experimental diesel locomotive known informally as "The Fell Diesel Locomotive" (after Lt. Col. L.F.R. Fell, who was one of the designers). It was the joint production of Davey Paxman & Co, Shell Refining & Marketing Co and Lt-Col L.F.R. Fell, built for them by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway at Derby. Sir Harry Ricardo was also involved. By the time it emerged in 1950, nationalisation had taken place and it carried British Railways livery. The locomotive had six diesel engines, four of them used for traction. The auxiliary engines drove the pressure-chargers for the main engines and the purpose of this arrangement was to enable the main engines to deliver very high torque at low crankshaft speed.

British Rail Class D16/2

British Railways Class D16/2 was a class of prototype diesel locomotive built by BR at Ashford Works and introduced in 1950–1951, with a third example being introduced in 1954. They had been designed by Oliver Bulleid for the Southern Railway before the 1948 nationalisation but did not appear until after nationalisation. The diesel engine and transmission were supplied by the English Electric company but the Bulleid influence was obvious. The box-like body style closely resembled Bulleid's electric locomotives and was quite different from the usual English Electric style, typified by British Rail Class D16/1.

British Rail 10800

British Railways 10800 was a diesel locomotive built by the North British Locomotive Company for British Railways in 1950. It had been ordered by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1946 but did not appear until after the 1948 nationalisation of the railways. 

British Rail Class D20/2

The British Railways Class D20/2 diesel-hydraulic locomotives were built by the North British Locomotive Company in Glasgow during 1957 and 1958. Although never assigned a TOPS class as they were withdrawn before TOPS was introduced British Loco enthusiasts coined the term "Class 41". All were named after Royal Navy vessels, hence the nameplates each bore a subtitle "Warship Class".

Steam locomotives of British Railways

The steam locomotives of British Railways were used by British Railways over the period 1948-1968. The majority of these were inherited from the Big Four British railway companies. In the 1950s, new British Railways Standard steam locomotives were introduced.

BR locomotives were numbered in the following series:

British Rail Class 98

TOPS Class 98 has been used to cover all steam locomotives used on the mainline in Britain, but also has a particular usage for the three Vale of Rheidol Railway-design 2-6-2T locomotives that remained in the ownership of British Rail after the end of mainline steam traction in August 1968. The locomotives on the Vale of Rheidol Railway were the only steam locomotives ever officially to carry the British Rail corporate blue and the double arrow logo.

Gatwick Express

Gatwick Express is the name of a fast train service that runs on the Brighton Main Line, a railway line between Victoria station in London and the city of Brighton and Hove in South East England, stopping at Gatwick Airport on the way. It is fast because it does not stop at any stations between London Victoria and Gatwick Airport.

A Gatwick Express train leaves London Victoria station every 15 minutes and takes 30 minutes to get to Gatwick Airport station. After arriving at Gatwick Airport, at least every other train on weekdays and Saturdays continues non-stop to Brighton railway station. At peak hours, every train continues to Brighton, but makes two stops between Gatwick and Brighton. On Sundays, all trains end at Gatwick Airport; there are no trains to and from Brighton.

Before June 2008, Gatwick Express was a train operating company (TOC) and was a franchise owned by Southern, another TOC that has trains on other routes. On 22 June 2008, the Gatwick Express TOC was closed. Now the Gatwick Express is directly operated by Southern, but it is still called Gatwick Express.

The Gatwick Express service has used many types of trains over the years. Most of them were designed just for the service.

Freightliner Group

Freightliner Group Limited is a rail freight and logistics company, founded in 1995 and now operating in the United Kingdom and Poland. It is the second largest rail freight operator in the UK, after EWS. 

Railfreight Distribution

In its early years the division was occasionally referred to as Speedlink Distribution. It was later responsible for freight operations through the Channel Tunnel.

British Rail locomotive and multiple unit numbering and classification

A number of different numbering and classification schemes were used for locomotives and multiple units operated by British Railways (BR), and this page explains the principal systems. This section also covers the post-privatisation period, as the broad numbering and classification arrangements have not altered since the break-up of BR.

For further information on individual classes of locomotive or multiple unit, see these pages:

Motor Rail

Motor Rail was a British locomotive-building company, based in Bedford. Formed in 1911 as The Motor Rail & Tramcar Co Ltd, they built petrol and diesel engined locomotives, mainly narrow gauge. During World War I over 900 locos were supplied for use on temporary military supply railways. The trade name Simplex was used from the early days; in 1972 the company was renamed Simplex Mechanical Handling Ltd.

London and North Eastern Railway

The London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) was the second-largest of the "Big Four" railway companies created by the Railways Act 1921 in Britain. It existed from 1 January 1923 until nationalisation on 1 January 1948, when it was divided into the new British Railways' Eastern Region, North Eastern Region and partially the Scottish Region.


Metropolitan-Vickers

Metropolitan-Vickers, Metrovick, or Metrovicks, was a British heavy electrical engineering company of the early-to-mid 20th century formerly known as British Westinghouse. Highly diversified, they were particularly well known for their industrial electrical equipment such as generators, steam turbines, switchgear, transformers, electronics and railway traction equipment. Metrovick holds a place in history as the builders of the first commercial transistor computer, the Metrovick 950, and the first British axial-flow jet engine, the Metrovick F.2. Their factory in Trafford Park, Manchester, was for most of the 20th century one of the biggest and most important heavy engineering facilities in Britain and the world.

British Rail Class 99

The British Rail Class 99 was a fleet of 14 ferries, mostly owned by Sealink, which carried rail vehicles between Britain and mainland Europe. When British Rail implemented the TOPS system for managing their operating stock, these ships were incorporated into the system in order to circumvent some of the restrictions of the application software. This allowed them to be counted as locomotives while carrying railway vehicles in the same way as a normal locomotive would haul a train.

English Electric

English Electric (EE) was a British industrial manufacturer. Founded in 1918, it initially specialised in industrial electric motors and transformers. Its activities would expand to include railway locomotives and traction equipment, steam turbines, consumer electronics, guided missiles, aircraft and computers. 

English Electric Diesel Engines was the diesel engine division of English Electric. It built diesel engines under the names English Electric, Napier and Dorman.

Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company

The Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company (BRC&W) was a railway locomotive and carriage builder, founded in Birmingham, England. For most of its existence, it was at nearby Smethwick, with the factory divided by the boundary between the two places. The company was established in 1854.

Brush Traction

Brush Traction is a manufacturer and maintainer of railway locomotives, based at Loughborough in Leicestershire, United Kingdom alongside the Midland Main Line.

Yorkshire Engine Company

The Yorkshire Engine Company (YEC) was a small independent locomotive manufacturer in Sheffield, England. The company was formed in 1865 and continued to produce locomotives and carry out general engineering work until 1965. Mainly known for shunting engines for the British market, but also built main line engines for overseas customers.

Ephesus

Ephesus (; ) was an ancient Greek city on the west coast of Anatolia, now in Turkey. It was one of the twelve cities of the Ionian League. The Apostle Paul is said to have addressed an epistle to the Christians of the city., and it is now known as the Epistle to the Ephesians in the New Testament. The site still possesses many well preserved Roman ruins side by side with rich history. 

Most significant are the odeon, used as a concert hall and city council with the capacity of 1.500 people, Temple of Hadrian dating back to the second century where one of the best sculpture craftsmanship can be seen, Curettes Street hosting many monuments and countless colums on the sides of its marble paved ground, a fountain dedicated to Emperor Trajan where a part of a remaining statue shows us that Romans knew the round shape of the world in the first century AD, and latrines (toilets) where it can be seen how they cared about public sanity. 

Two other of Ephesus's outstanding monuments hold importance not just for their home city also for world's cultural and architectural heritage. The first one is the library of Celsus which is located at the end of the Curettes Street. The library looks like a two storeyed building seen from the facade but as we know it former had three stories inside. The facade shows a rare found craftsmanship. Also the library was the third biggest library of the ancient world, after the libraries of Alexandria and Pergamon. Anyone who stands in front of this monumental building can understand why did it take twenty years (115 AD to 135 AD) to complete it. 

The second one is Ephesus' grand theatre which had the capacity of 25.000 spectators. It was not just a place of art also as we know it was used for animal and gladiator fights. With its great dimensions it makes one think about how small my moment in time really is. It's one of the sacred ruins of Ephesus, according to the Acts of the Apostles (19:23-41), the theater was the site of the "riot of the silversmiths" in which those who made silver figures of Artemis the pagan godess of the city rioted because Paul's preaching was bad for business. In the 1st century AD, the Apostle Paul spent over three years in Ephesus and he sermonized many times, disapproving pagan worship, in this theater.



Je (Cyrillic)

Je (Ј, Ј̇, ј) is a letter of the Cyrillic alphabet, used in the Serbian, Macedonian, Azeri, and Altai languages.

In Serbian, Macedonian and Azeri this letter sounds like [y]. Since the letters Я (ya), Є (ye), Ё (yo), Ї (yi) and Ю (yu) are not used in those languages, they are written as Ja, Je, Jo, Jи and Jy.

It is also used in the Altai language to show [ʤ] or [j].

In Russian, Bulgarian, Ukrainian and Belarusian languages, Й is used instead of Ј.

Craniata

Craniata (sometimes Craniota) is a proposed clade of chordate animals that contains the vertebrates (subphylum Vertebrata) and Myxini (hagfish) as living representatives. Craniata includes all animals with a skull, or cranium, as the name suggests.

These two taxa lack proper vertebrae, which are characteristic for vertebrates according to the new interpretation, whereas traditionally—and confusingly—they were not (Hickman et al., 2007).

Ka (Cyrillic)

Ka (К, к) is the tenth letter in the Cyrillic alphabet. It sounds like [k].

It comes from the Greek letter kappa and is the same as the Roman K.


El (Cyrillic)

El (Л, л) is the eleventh letter of the Cyrillic alphabet. It sounds like [l]. It comes from the Greek letter lambda and is the same as the Roman L. It looks like Pe, (П, п), another letter in the same alphabet but its left leg is curved.


Kingdom of Tungning

The Kingdom of Tungning was the first Han Chinese government to rule Taiwan. It ruled between 1661 and 1683. It was a pro-Ming Dynasty kingdom. It was started by Koxinga, after the destruction of Ming government by the Manchu. Koxinga was son of a pirate who was a supporter of the Ming Dynasty. He hoped to get his soldiers together on Taiwan and use it as a base to get back mainland China for the Ming Dynasty.

The Kingdom of Tungning is also sometimes known as:

Admiral Koxinga called Taiwan Tungtu/Dongdu. In western history books it is known as the Kingdom of Taiwan.

In 1661, Koxinga forced a landing at Luerhmen, Taiwan. In less than a year, he took Fort Zeelandia and made an agreement with Frederick Coyett, the Dutch governor. The Dutch gave him the fort and left all the goods and property of the Dutch East India Company behind. All the Dutch people, officials and soldiers were able take their "personal" things and supplies back to Batavia in safety. This ended 38 years of Dutch colonial rule on Taiwan. Koxinga kept himself busy making Taiwan into a useful base for anti-Qing Dynasty supporters who hoped to get the Ming Dynasty back to power.

In 1662, at the age of 39, Koxinga died of malaria. Some people said that he died in a sudden fit of craziness when he heard about the death of his father under the Qing. His son, Zheng Jing, took control as the ruler of Taiwan, with the name of Prince of Yanping.

For the next 19 years, Zheng Jing tried to run the country and rebuild his army in Taiwan. Contact with the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty from the China through ambassadors was frequent. Zheng Jing fought the Qing to defend Xiamen, Quemoy and the Pescadores islands, which he finally lost over the years. His small army army was not big enough to defend the islands from the Qing. During Revolt of the Three Feudatories, Zheng Jing started an attack in the Fujian area. At the end of the revolt, Zheng's army was defeated. After the defeat, Zheng went back to Taiwan where he spent his time with wine and women, dying soon after of illness. After his death, his generals and ministers were split into two groups, each supporting one of his sons to take take over. After some fighting, Zheng Keshuang, his 12 year old son, became the new king.

In 1683, after the Battle of Penghu, Zheng Keshuang gave himself up to the Qing. His kingdom was added to the Qing Dynasty as part of the Fujian Province.

The Kingdom of Tungning lasted for just over 20 years. Because its history is almost the same as modern Taiwan, it has great symbolic value.

After its defeat in the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the Republic of China (ROC), led by the Kuomintang, went to Taiwan. They left mainland China to the Communist Party who started the People's Republic of China (PRC). For many years, the ROC planned to take control of the mainland. It kept island bases close to the mainland (for example, Quemoy). This was the same as Koxinga and his sons had done. The ROC has now become a democracy and no longer wants to take over the mainland. The political and territorial arrangement has not changed. In this way, it is the same as between the Qing/Koxinga situation and the current PRC/ROC situation.

The Kuomintang of the ROC have talked a lot about the goals of Koxinga. They were going to use Taiwan as a base for returning their government to Mainland China. They see themselves as the defenders of the ROC. They see Taiwan as a base from which the ROC will take back control of the mainland. The PRC talks about the fact that Koxinga freed Taiwan from Dutch colonialism for the sake of the motherland. They do not talk about the fact that Koxinga was trying to get rid of the mainland government, to bring back an earlier dynasty.

Bredevoort

Bredevoort is a small village in the municipality of Aalten, in the region of Achterhoek in the Netherlands. It is between the towns of Aalten and Winterswijk. About 1,600 people live there.

Today they name Bredevoort also "Bredevoort boekenstad" ("Bredevoort book town"). There are now more than twenty second-hand book shops in the town.

The name Bredevoort appears for the first time in 1188, when the earl of Steinfurt tried to sell his share of the castle to the bishop of Münster and the earl of Lohn tried to sell his share to the earl of Gelderland, a war broke out between the bishop and the earl of Gelderland. The fight lasted for almost two centuries. From 1326, Bredevoort was actual part of Gelderland. Between 1326 and 1696 the municipality of Bredevoort repeatedly changed ownership during the eighties years of war. In 1646, lightning hit the gunpowder tower of the castle of Bredevoort, causing an explosion that destroyed the castle and the town, killing Lord Haersolte of Bredevoort and his family, as well as others. Only one son, Anthonie, who was not home that day, survived. The former municipality of Bredevoort was comprised of the city, the castle Bredevoort, and the villages Aalten, Dinxperlo and Winterswijk. After centuries of war, its fortifications were demolished by its residents. In 1818, the municipality of Bredevoort was dissolved to become part of the city Bredevoort under the newly formed municipality Aalten.

Alsace–Lorraine

The Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine ( or , or ) was a territory created by the German Empire in 1871 after its victory in the Franco-Prussian War. It was made up of almost all of the French region of Alsace and about a quarter of Lorraine, hence its name. France took it back in 1918 and it became part of that country as a result of Treaty of Versailles in 1919. Nazi Germany "de facto" took it back in 1940 but France took it back in 1945.

The territory has been part of France since then. In 2016 it became part of the Region of Grand Est.

British Rail coach designations

The London, Midland and Scottish Railway and the London and North Eastern Railway both developed a system of identifying carriages by means of alphabetic codes. When British Railways was formed in 1948, it decided to adopt the former LNER method of carriage classification.

The codes are made up from a combination of letters, some of which can indicate more than one word; their meaning can only be determined according to their position, or the presence of other letters, in the code. The letters used are:
These letters (except for "Y" and "Z") did not usually apply to the wide variety of passenger-rated but goods carrying vans (e.g. parcels vans, horse boxes, milk and fish vans). Their codes were an acronym of their traditional railway description, e.g. GUV for General Utility Vans.

The following list lists those codes that were actually used on British Railways, cross-referred to the comparable code used by the LMS, with the exception that the letter "S" (""Second"", later ""Standard"") is used where until 1956 the letter "T" (""Third"") is used. Suffix codes "Y" or "Z" are not shown, as these could apply to variants of any or all vehicle types.

In the original LNER coding system, "S" stood for ""Second"", an intermediate class between "First" and "Third" (which later became "Second"). The original "Second" was more or less abolished in the 1870s (as a result of the Railway Regulation Act 1844), remaining only in limited use for special services, such as those meeting ships (which retained the three-class system from which railway classifications had originated). In the 1980s, BR renamed "Second" to "Standard". Many of the classifications listed below are no longer used, and some did not survive until the designation ""Standard"".

Note that in modern usage, composite semi-open vehicles are classified "Cso" – the "s" signifying that the Standard portion is open (implying that the First portion is compartments with corridor).


Shiro Kikuhara

Kikuhara was born in Kanagawa Prefecture on July 7, 1969. He joined Yomiuri (later "Verdy Kawasaki") from youth team in 1985.

In Asia, the club also won 1987 Asian Club Championship. In 1992, Japan Soccer League was folded and founded new league J1 League. The club won 1993 J1 League, 1992 and 1993 J.League Cup. However his opportunity to play decreased. So he moved to Urawa Reds in 1994. He returned to Verdy Kawasaki in 1996 and retired end of the season.

On July 29, 1990, Kikuhara debuted for the Japan national team against China. He also played at 1990 Asian Games. He played 5 games for Japan in 1990.

SR multiple unit numbering and classification

The Southern Railway created classification and numbering systems for its large fleet of electric multiple units that were perpetuated by the Southern Region of British Rail until the early 1980s, when the impact of TOPS was felt. Even now, some stock have still been allocated Southern-style classifications in a semi-official manner.

Virgin Trains

Virgin Trains was a train operating company in the United Kingdom. They ran trains from London Euston to the North West, West Midlands and Scotland on the West Coast Main Line and trains on the East Coast Main Coast Mainline between London, Yorkshire, the North East and Scotland. Before 11 November 2007, they also run trains linking the south and south-west of England with the north of England through Manchester and Scotland, through Birmingham, under the CrossCountry franchise. Although it is branded as part of Virgin Group, Virgin's share in the company is only 51%, with the remaining 49% owned by Stagecoach. Virgin's share in Virgin Trains East Coast is only 10% with 90% being owned by Stagecoach, although the company is also branded under the Virgin name. The East Coast franchise was transferred to London North Eastern Railway in 2019, and the West Coast franchise to Avanti West Coast.

Their first trains, formerly owned by British Rail, were very old and broken down, but were replaced by new trains in 2002 on the West Coast and CrossCountry lines. New trains were built for their East Coast operations. 

 

CrossCountry

CrossCountry is a train operating company, the brand name of XC Trains Limited owned by Arriva, that has operated Great Britain’s Cross Country rail franchise since 11 November 2007.

It was used to fly the longest planned flight in the world, from Singapore to Newark but only to be flown by the Airbus A340-500 until they were dropped in November 2013 until they operate it back with the new Airbus A350-900ULR in October 2018 with modified fuel system. In addition, there is also a low-cost airline, called Scoot. Scoot is the airline that has a mix of Airbus A320 and Boeing 787.

Singapore Airlines was given "Airline of the Year" by Skytrax in 2008. Its hub, Singapore Changi Airport, was given "Airport of the Year" in 2006.

The Singapore Airlines fleet features exclusively wide-body aircraft from four aircraft families: the Boeing 777, Airbus A380, Airbus A350, and the Airbus A330. As of 31 October 2017, there were 111 aircraft registered in the Singapore Airlines fleet.

Five further A330s were delivered in 2009, progressively replacing older Boeing 777-200s on medium-haul routes, and the fleet stood at 19 examples by June 2011. All the aircraft were acquired on five-year leases with the option to extend if necessary, designed to fill the airline's capacity requirements until the delivery of Airbus A350s and Boeing 787s.

The airline committed to an additional 15 A330 aircraft in June 2011, which were delivered between 2013 and 2015, continuing to replace older Boeing 777s in the fleet. The A330 fleet was the second largest by type in the airline as of 31 August 2016 (after the Boeing 777 fleet) with 27 aircraft in service. In January 2016 the airline confirmed its intention to eventually replace all A330 aircraft with Airbus A350s in a medium-range configuration by 2019.

Singapore Airlines placed an order for 30 Airbus A350-900 aircraft in 2006, with a further 30 orders placed in 2013. The airline took delivery of the first of the aircraft in February 2016 and flew its delivery flight to Singapore on 2 March. The airline began operating regular services using the A350 on the Singapore-Amsterdam route from 9 May 2016.

On 13 October 2015, Singapore Airlines announced that it had placed orders for seven Airbus A350-900ULR (Ultra-Long Range), which will see the return of non-stop flights between Singapore and both New York and Los Angeles.

Edward Cave

Edward Cave, ( February 27 1691 – January 10 1754), was an English printer, editor and publisher. In "The Gentleman's Magazine" he made the first general-interest "magazine". 

The son of a cobbler, Cave was born in Newton near Rugby, Warwickshire and attended the grammar school there. Cave was made to leave after it was said he stole from the headmaster. He worked at a number of different jobs, such as selling timber, writing and printing. He came up with the idea of a periodical that would cover every subject the educated public was interested in, from commerce to poetry. He tried to get some London printers and booksellers to take up the idea. When no one showed any interest, Cave took on the job by himself. "The Gentleman's Magazine" was started in 1731 and soon became the most important and most copied periodical of its time. It also made Cave very rich.

Cave was a smart businessman. He gave all his energy to the magazine, and hardly ever left its offices at St John's Gate, Clerkenwell. He made use of a lot of writers, the most famous was Samuel Johnson, who was always thankful to Cave for having given him his main job for many years. Cave himself often sent in items to the Magazine under the pen name of Sylvanus Urban. 

He also got permission from Lewis Paul for 250 spindles for his patent roller-spinning machine, an early model of the water frame. In 1742 he bought Marvels Mill at Northampton and made this into a cotton mill. This was probably the first water-powered spinning mill in the world. This should have made a lot of money, but it did not. It closed about 1761. 

Cave suffered from gout. He is buried at St. James Church, Clerkenwell.

Great Rift Valley

The Great Rift Valley or East African Rift is a continuous geographical trench, about 6,440 kilometres (3,700 mi) in length, that runs from northern Syria in Southwest Asia to central Mozambique in East Africa. The rift is bordered by a series of mountains and active volcanoes. It is a site of faults and earthquakes.

Basically, the western part of Africa is rifting away from the eastern part. This causes all the geological activity at the Valley. Far in the future, a sea will run between these two parts of Africa. The Arabian peninsula is already almost separated. The whole process is part of plate tectonics. In eastern Africa, the valley divides into two, the Western Rift Valley and the Eastern Rift Valley.

There are about 20 UNESCO World Heritage Sites which owe their formation to the geography and geology of the Great Rift Valley.

The Western Rift is edged by some of the highest mountains in Africa. It contains the Rift Valley lakes, which include some of the deepest lakes in the world (up to 1,470 metres deep at Lake Tanganyika). Much of this area is inside national parks.

The African Great Lakes are a series of lakes formed by the tectonic action of the East African Rift. Most lie within its rift valley.. They include Lake Victoria, the second largest fresh water lake in the world in terms of surface area, and Lake Tanganyika, the world's second largest in volume as well as the second deepest.

The African Great Lakes are divided among three different catchments (river basins). Some, such as Lake Turkana, have internal drainage systems. The largest, in order of size from largest to smallest are:

The lakes in the Eastern Rift have no outlet to the sea and tend to be shallow, they have a high mineral content as the evaporation of water leaves the salts behind.

Lake Malawi (or Lake Nyasa: the name is disputed) is the most southern of the Great Lakes, and empties into the great Zambezi River via the Shire River.

Scottish Parliament

The Scottish Parliament (; Scots: "Scottish Pairlament") is the devolved national legislature of Scotland. It is in the capital city, Edinburgh. The Parliament is sometimes called "Holyrood" because it is located next to Holyrood Palace.

The original Parliament of Scotland (or "Estates of Scotland") was the national legislature of the independent Kingdom of Scotland. It existed from the early 13th century until 1707. This was when the Kingdom of Scotland merged with the Kingdom of England under the Acts of Union 1707 to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain. 

Because of this, the Parliament of Scotland merged with the Parliament of England to form the Parliament of Great Britain, which sat at Westminster in London. This legislature merged with the Irish Parliament from 1801 to make the current Parliament of the United Kingdom.

In 1997 there was a referendum where the Scottish people voted for Scotland to have a Parliament again. The current Parliament was established by the Scotland Act 1998. The first meeting was on 12 May 1999.

The Parliament is a devolved assembly, which means that some powers have been kept by the UK Parliament. The issues which the Scottish Parliament can make laws about are called "devolved matters". The issues which the UK Parliament must make laws about are called "reserved matters". Some examples of devolved matters are health and social services, education and housing. Examples of reserved matters are foreign policy, immigration and the constitution of the Scottish Parliament.

There are 129 members known as Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) who are democratically elected. Members are elected for five-year terms. Most of the MSPs belong to political parties. Independent MSPs do not belong to a political party.

The number of MSPs from each party are:

The Presiding Officer is the Speaker of the Scottish Parliament and chairs the meetings. The Presiding Officer is an MSP elected to the role and cannot be bias towards one party.




Joseph Banks Rhine

Joseph Banks Rhine (September 29, 1895 – February 20, 1980); usually known as J. B. Rhine) was a pioneer of parapsychology. Rhine founded the parapsychology lab at Duke University, the "Journal of Parapsychology", and the Foundation for Research on the Nature of Man. He also initiated the Parapsychological Association.

Joule's laws

Joule's laws are two: first about heat produced by an electric current, and second about how the energy of a gas relates to pressure, volume.

Joule's first law shows the relation between heat generated by an electric current flowing through a conductor. It is named after James Prescott Joule and shown as:

Where "Q" is the amount of heat, "I" is the electric current flowing through a conductor, "R" is the amount of electric resistance present in the conductor, and "t" is the amount of time that this happens for. 

Joule's second law says that the internal energy of an ideal gas does not change if volume and pressure change, but does change if temperature changes.

Joule's law is important.

Pinnacle Point Man

The Pinnacle Point Man is a name given to a group of Homo sapiens believed to have lived in a cave at Pinnacle Point 164,000 years ago. This cave is near Mosselbaai/Mossel Bay on the south coast South Africa. Discoveries in the cave show that these early humans were able to work with haematite pieces, and used ochre to paint their bodies. The discovery challenges the widely held belief that modern human behaviour began only 45,000 years ago. It also challenges the view that this behaviour was reached through a "large cultural leap".

Because the African climate became cool and dry, the food resources were reduced dramatically. This was the reason why the Pinnacle Point man moved to the shores. There, they could eat marine creatures like mussels, snails and crabs. These men also used amazingly subtle tools. Microliths were mounted on wood shafts

The startling discovery was made in 2007 by an international team, including the palaeoanthropologist Curtis Marean from the "Institute of Human Origins" of the Arizona State University and three graduate students of the "School of Human Evolution and Social Change". They came to the conclusion that humans living in the cave started to eat new foods. They added shellfish and other marine resources to their diet. The cause for this evolution was the climate change. It is the first evidence that mankind was able to this. The report in the magazine Nature also reports that the evidence for using coloured pigments was also found. This is much earlier than the earliest known usage which had been from 70,000 years ago.

The findings give rise to the assumption that living near the coast has caused the changes.

The evidence shows that Homo sapiens evolved in Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. At that time, the world was in an ice age, and Africa was a desert. But as archaeologica sites dating to that time period are rare in Africa, palaeonthologist Curtis Marean looked at different information. He studied geologic formations, the sea currents, climate data and much more. As a result, he was able to pinpoint his research to destinations like the Pinnacle Point cave, where the findings have been made.

Web service

A Web service is defined as "a designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network". Web services are frequently just Web APIs that can be accessed over a network, such as the Internet, and executed on a remote system the requested services.

The W3C Web service definition encompasses many different systems, but in common usage the term refers to clients and servers that communicate over the HTTP used on the Web. Such services tend to fall into one of two camps: Big Web Services and RESTful Web Services.

"Big Web Services" use XML messages that follow the SOAP standard and have been popular with traditional enterprise. In such systems, there is often a machine-readable description of the operations offered by the service written in the Web Services Description Language (WSDL). The latter is not a requirement of a SOAP endpoint, but it is a prerequisite for automated client-side code generation in many Java and .NET SOAP frameworks (frameworks such as Spring, Apache Axis2 and Apache CXF being notable exceptions). Some industry organizations, such as the WS-I, mandate both SOAP and WSDL in their definition of a Web service.

More recently, RESTful Web services have been regaining popularity, particularly with Internet companies. These also meet the W3C definition, and are often better integrated with HTTP than SOAP-based services. They do not require XML messages or WSDL service-API definitions.

Pricing

Pricing is the creation of a price. In a market economy the price is made by supply and demand. The suppliers would like to get the price as high as possible and the consumers would like to pay as few as possible. Prices will be built if consumers and salesmen make an agreement of the exchange of goods.
There are many consumers but only a few suppliers.

There are many consumers but only one supplier.

Many suppliers are compared to many consumers. By the low market share of the individual supplier you call it "atomize market structure". You also call this market form competitive market.



The supplier will offer more goods, if the market price is rising. (and backwards)

The consumer will demand more goods, if the market price drops. (and backwards)

OEM

OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturing. It is mainly used to describe parts for cars, airplanes and electrical systems. It is also used for computer parts and computer programs.

The name OEM is usually used when a new version of something is made by a company that is different to the company that first made it. The new company will sell the product at a cheaper price, but this is often because it does not have as many features as the first version. For example, an OEM computer program will usually only come with the disc and a licence, but no instruction manuals.

Pubis (bone)

The pubis, or pubic bone, is one of the bones that make up the pelvis. It is ventral and anterior. In other words, it is at the front in humans, and below in most other mammals. 

The left and right hip bones join at the pubic symphysis. In the female, the pubic bone in front is covered by the urethral sponge. This is a layer of fat, forming the mons pubis or mons Venus.

The body of the pubis forms one-fifth of the acetabulum, the area around the hip socket. It contributes to the hip socket itself. Its inner surface is part of the wall of the lesser pelvis.

Brown tree snake

The Brown tree snake ("Boiga irregularis") is an arboreal colubrid snake the lives in parts of coastal Australia, Papua New Guinea, and islands in northwestern Melanesia.

This snake is known for being an invasive species, responsible for killing the bird population on Guam.

The Brown tree snake eats birds, lizards, and bats. It also eats small rodents in its home. It also eats birds and shrews at Guam.

Due to the amount of prey and lack of predators in habitats such as Guam, they have been known to grow to larger sizes than their normal 1 to 2 meters in length. The longest recorded length of this species is one found on Guam was three meters.

Reproduction has not been looked at in detail. The female makes 4-12 eggs, 42–47 mm long and 18–22 mm wide with a leathery shell. Females make up to two groups, called clutches per year depending on season, climate. and amount of prey. The female places the eggs in hollow logs, rock cracks, and other places where they are likely protected from drying and high temperatures.

The Brown tree snake is a nocturnal snake that can be very aggressive when confronted. The fangs are grooved rather than hollow fangs, the poison is hard to place into a bite on a human, in this way, is only given in small amount. The venom appears to be weakly neurotoxic and possibly cytotoxic. Adults are not affectly in a great way, however, children are in greater danger.

Flogging

Flagellation or flogging is hitting the body with a whip. The word comes from "flagellum," the Latin word for "Whip". Usually it is done as a punishment.

Flogging was used to punish convicts in the penal colonies of Australia. After Irish convicts tried to start a riot at Castle Hill in 1804, many were flogged. Paddy Galvin was given 300 lashes at Parramatta, New South Wales. The first one hundred were across his back, and tore open his skin so the bones in his spine could be seen. The second hundred was given across his behind which became like jelly. A doctor ordered that the third hundred was given across the back of his legs. People watching were hit by pieces of skin and flesh. There are records in Tasmania of a convict named Greenwood, being given 1000 lashes for wounding an officer while trying to escape.

History of Curitiba

The history of Curitiba has many different periods.

In the past, the region where today is the city of Curitiba was a region of exuberant forest, where the parana-pine was dominant. The first inhabitants of the region were the indigenous tribe Tingüi, by the Tupi-Guarani nation.

At the beginning of the Christian Era, the Plateau Curitibano (also known as First Plateau of Paraná) was inhabited by peoples potters. Subterranean houses, found at archaeological sites on the outskirts of Curitiba, show the adaptation of native to the adverse conditions of climate, as the cold wind, frost and snow.

In time of arrival of the Portuguese to Brazil, the Plateau Curitibano was occupied by groups of linguistic families Jê and Tupi-Guarani.

The first ten years of the 16th century marked the beginning of a war of conquest of Europeans against the indigenous peoples who inhabited the plateaus of southeastern and southern Brazil. Were Portuguese and Spanish expeditions in search of precious metals and stones, and Indians to enslave. 

The region of Curitiba began to be populated by non-Indians around 1630, by people from Paranaguá, where the alluvium gold had been discovered, forming the village of "Our Lady of Light and Good Jesus of Pine Forest", which was became in town in 1693. The Portuguese who founded a village in 1693 gave it the name of "Vila da Nossa Senhora da Luz dos Pinhais" ("Our Lady of the Light in the Pine Forest"). The name was changed to "Curitiba" in 1721. 

There is a legend telling that around 1648 a group of pioneers founded a small village near the Atuba River while searching for gold. These pioneers venerated "Nossa Senhor da Luz" and made a special place there for her statue. The legend tells that every morning the image turned her eyes to a pine tree forest, which the pioneers knew was a sacred place of the Indians. The explorers took this as a sign that "Nossa Senhora" was showing them a special place for their village. Even though they knew that the Indians took them as enemies, the pioneers took the risk and went in to the forest to find this special place. When the pioneers got close to the tribe, a miracle happened: the Indians were peaceful and expecting them to come. Done contact with the leader of the Tingüi tribe, the cacique Tindiqüera would have said the new location and put a stick in the ground, saying "Coré Etuba" ("many pines"). By this stick would have grown a great tree, where today is the "zero mark" of Curitiba. At that place the pioneers built a chapel in honor of the saint, now called "Nossa Senhora da Luz dos Pinhais" ("Our Lady of the Light in the Pine Forest").
Curitiba officially became a town in 1812, orthography its name as "Curityba". An alternative orthography also came up: "Coritiba". This orthography looked to become dominant for it was used in press and state documents, but a state decree in 1919 decided the dispute by orthography the city name "Curitiba". Growth was based on the cattle trade, being a way between cattle breeding country to the South and markets to the North. Developing effective started from the beginning of the 19th century, with the exploitation and exportation of Yerba mate ("Ilex paraguariensis"), and the elevation to the condition that city in 1842.

Waves of European immigrants started arriving after 1850, mainly Germans, Italians, Poles and Ukrainians. In 1853, the south and southwest of the province of São Paulo are separated, forming the new province of Paraná, and Curitiba has become capital. The "Universidade Federal do Paraná" (Federal University of Paraná), the first in Brazil, was established in Curitiba in 1913, the same year in which electric streetcars were first deployed.

As most of Southern Brazil's population, Curitiba is mostly inhabited by Brazilians of European descent. The first Europeans to arrive in the region were of Portuguese origin, during the 17th century. They intermarried with the native people and with the African slaves.

In the 19th century, the influx of immigrants from Europe increased. In 1828, the first German immigrants settled in Paraná. However, large numbers of immigrants from Germany only arrived in Curitiba during the 1870s, most of them was Volga Germans from Russia.
Immigrants from Poland first arrived in 1871, settling in rural areas near to Curitiba. They largely influenced the agriculture of the region. Curitiba has the second largest Polish diaspora in the world, second only to Chicago, and is the only Brazilian city to have orthography in Polish language: "Kurytyba".

Italian immigrants started arriving in Curitiba in 1878. They came mostly from the Veneto and Trento regions, in Northern Italy and settled mostly in the Santa Felicidade neighborhood, still today the center of the large Italian community of Curitiba.

Large numbers of Ukrainian immigrants settled in Curitiba, mostly between 1895 and 1897, when 20 thousands arrived. They were peasants from Galicia, who immigrated to Brazil to become small farmers. Nowadays there are 300 thousand Ukrainian-Brazilians living in Paraná.

Japanese immigrants starting arriving in the region in 1915. Curitiba received significant numbers of immigrants from Japan. Nowadays, there are about 40 thousand Japanese-Brazilians living in the city. 

Other immigrants, such as jewishes, Arabs from Lebanon and Syria, English, French, Russians and other Eastern Europeans also settled in Curitiba.

During the 20th century, especially after the middle, the city is going through a large increase in population and is consolidating as regional hub for trade and services, becoming one of the richest cities in Brazil and pioneer in urban solutions. In the 1940s and 1950s, Alfred Agache, co-founder of the French Society for Urban Studies, was hired to produce the first city plan. It emphasised a "star" of boulevards, with public amenities downtown, an industrial district and sanitation. It was followed when possible, but was too expensive to complete.

By the 1960s, Curitiba's population had increased to 430,000, and some residents feared that the growth in population threatened to drastically change the character of the city. In 1964, Mayor Ivo Arzua solicited proposals for urban design. Architect Jaime Lerner - who later became mayor - led a team from the Universidade Federal do Paraná that suggested strict controls on urban sprawl, a reduction of traffic in the downtown area, preservation of Curitiba's Historic Sector, and a convenient and affordable public transit system. This plan, known as the Curitiba Master Plan, was adopted in 1968. Lerner closed the XV de Novembro St. to vehicles, because it had very high pedestrian traffic. The plan had a new road design to minimise traffic: the Trinary Road System. This uses two one-way streets moving in opposite directions which surround a smaller, two-lane street where the express buses have their exclusive lane. Five of these roads form a star that converges to the city centre. Land farther from these roads is zoned for lower density developments, to reduce traffic away from the main roads. A number of areas subject to floods were condemned and became parks.

Currently, the immigration of foreigners is small - is common only immigrants from China, some Middle Eastern and South American countries -, has been replaced by migration of Brazilians from other regions of the country (it is estimated that nowadays about half the population of Curitiba is composed of migrants).

Cosmopolitan

Cosmopolitan is a word considered first made by Diogenes of Sinope and is made of two parts, "cosmos" and "politics". It can be used for:

Coimbra

Coimbra is a city in Portugal. It was the capital city of the country during the 12th century, and is home of the University of Coimbra, the oldest academic institution in the Portuguese language-speaking world.

According to the census of 2001, the city had a population of 101,069 inhabitants, and the municipality had a population of 148,443 inhabitants in a 319.4 km² land area. Over 430,000 inhabitants live in the Greater Metropolitan Area of Coimbra.

<br>

Corrientes

Corrientes is a city in Argentina. It is the capital city of the province of Corrientes, on the eastern shore of the Paraná River, and about 1,000 km from Buenos Aires. According to the census of 2001, the city had 328,689 people.

As the provincial capital, Corrientes is the most important city in the province, being an economical center, and holds the authorities and governmental institutions.

The annual average temperature is 21.3 degrees celsius, with maximum and minimum averages of 33 degrees celsius and 10 degrees celsius respectively. The annual rainfall is around 1,500 millimeters.

Emerald ash borer

The emerald ash borer ("Agrilus planipennis" or "Agrilus marcopoli") is a shiny green beetle native to Asia. It made its way into the United States on accident and has since been spread to eleven states and to the border with Canada.

The beetle is an invasive species, and a serious pest which destroys ash trees. It has killed at least 25 million ash trees so far and threatens to kill most of the ash trees throughout North America.

Adults lay eggs in crevasses in the bark. Larvae burrow into the bark after hatching and consume the living tissue of cambium and phloem. This causes death within two years. The average emerging season for the emerald ash borer is early spring to late summer. Females lay around 75 eggs, but up to 300 from early May to mid-July. The borer's life cycle is estimated to be one year in southern Michigan but may be up to two years in colder regions.

Huge efforts have been made to slow down its spread, but nothing has worked so far. Parasitoid wasps from Asia are being released, and a fungus which kills insects is being tried.

Ratite

The ratites are a group of medium to large birds, most of which are flightless. Most of them, including the largest (moas and elephant birds) are now extinct. 

Unlike other flightless birds, the ratites have no keel on their sternum. In a flying bird the sternum anchors the wing muscles. 

Most parts of the former super-continent Gondwana have ratites, or did have until the fairly recent past. Their closest living relatives are the tinamous of South America.

The classification used here includes all ratites in the order Struthioniformes, but not the tinamous. This may change in future.

It was once thought that ratites were all one monophyletic group, which evolved together in Gondwana in the Upper Cretaceous. Then they evolved in their separate ways as Gondwana split up, and the parts drifted apart. The parts became the modern southern continents, plus Africa and the Indian subcontinent.

However, modern gene analysis conflicts with this. DNA analysis shows that the ratites diverged from one another too recently to share a common Gondwanian ancestor. However, all analyses show that rheas (South America) and the living Australasian/Oceanian ratites "are" monophyletic. 

Recent analysis of twenty nuclear genes suggests that the flighted tinamous cluster within the ratite lineage. The timamids are the sister group of the Australo-Pacific ratites.

If so, this would make 'ratites', as a whole, paraphyletic rather than monophyletic. Since tinamous are weak fliers, this raises interesting questions about the evolution of flightlessness in this group. If timamous are inside the ratite lineage, then ratites evolved flightlessness at least three times. Re-evolution of flight in the tinamous would be an alternative explanation, but that has no precedent in bird evolution, while loss of flight is commonplace.

Tinamous are ratites. Therefore, ratites are a group of medium to large birds, most of whom are flightless, with the exception of the tinamous. The ratites evolved flightlessness more than once. The similarities between ostriches and the Australo-Pacific ratites is due to convergent evolution.

New Britain

New Britain is the largest island in the Bismarck Archipelago of Papua New Guinea. It was named for Otto von Bismarck. It is separated from the island of New Guinea by the Dampier Strait, and from New Ireland by St. George's Channel. The main towns of New Britain are Rabaul/Kokopo and Kimbe.

Gosford

Gosford is a city on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia, approximately 80 km north of Sydney. Gosford is the 18th largest local government area in Australia with a total resident population of 158,157.

Airlie Beach, Queensland

Airlie Beach is a town in the Whitsunday Region of Queensland, Australia. At the 2006 census, Airlie Beach had a population of 2,751. The greater Whitsunday region had a population of approximately 31,000.

Agama

Agama is a genus of lizards. It contains at least 31 species across Africa, where they are the most common lizard. 

They can be found in many sizes, from 5 inches to a foot in length and a wide variety of colors. One of the best known species is the red-headed rock agama ("Agama agama"), widespread in sub-Saharan Africa.

Hurricane Luis

Hurricane Luis was one of the most powerful storms of the very active 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. Even though Luis was strong it was still only the second strongest storm in 1995, the strongest was Hurricane Opal. Hurricane Luis was the strongest storm to hit the Leeward Islands since Hurricane Hugo in 1989. From August 22 to September 1 Humberto, Iris, Jerry, Luis, and Karen were active at the same time. Most of the places damaged by Luis were damaged only a week earlier by Hurricane Iris, except for the United States and Newfoundland (Canada) and most of the islands would be damaged again less than two weeks later by Hurricane Marilyn.

The early stages of Luis's formation is track back to a tropical wave that moved off of Africa on August 26. The next day it became Tropical Depression Thirteen near Cape Verde. It reached Tropical Storm status on the 29th and was named Luis. It reached hurricane status on August 30 and reach category 4 strength on September 2. The next day Luis reached it's highest winds of 150 mph making it a Category 4. Luis continued west and crossed over Barbuda late on September 4. At this time Luis came very close to Antigua, St. Barthelemy, St. Martin and Anguilla. Luis turned northwest and while it was 150 miles to the north of Puerto Rico Luis weakened to a category 2 hurricane, after being a major hurricane for a week. Luis kept slowly weakening and headed to the northeast. While Luis was offshore of Newfoundland he caused a wave more than 98 feet tall. Luis made landfall in eastern Newfoundland on September 11 while a category 1. That same day Luis became extratropical and died near Greenland.

These were the places impacted by Hurricane Luis. Many of the Island Countries were affected by Hurricane Iris a week before; many would also be affected by Hurricane Marilyn only ten days later.
Luis caused a lot of damage in Antigua and Barbuda because it made landfall in that country. In Antigua about 50% of houses were either destroyed of damaged. In Barbuda nearly 70% of houses were either destroyed of damaged. The government of the country spent about $350 million in U.S. Dollars to fix the damage.

In Bermuda winds were reported up to 46 mph. However, there was no damage or people killed in Bermuda. On September 11 a ship called Queen Elizabeth 2 got caught in the 98 foot wave that Luis caused. The ship was not damaged but it arrived late in New York.

The only Providence in Canada affected by Luis was Newfoundland.
In Newfoundland, Luis killed one person and caused about $500,000 in damage. Luis dropped 2.4 to 4.7 inches of rain while it passed over Newfoundland on September 11.

In Dominica, larges waves from Hurricane Luis caused one fisherman to get killed. Hurricane Luis caused about $47 million in damage to the island nation.

St. Martin, a small island was hurt most by Luis. Luis did not strike St. Martin, but it was hurt most by Luis because he caused 9 people to get killed and $1.8 billion in damage.

In North Carolina, a U.S. state, a wave caused one person to get killed. Also, in New York, a wave washed under a house and later destroyed causing $1.9 million in damage.

In Guadeloupe, Luis killed one. In Saint Barthelemy, winds were recorded up to 155 mph. In Saint Kitts and Nevis, damages from Luis were at $197 million.

After Hurricane Luis many organizations and Governments donated money to help fix the damage on the affect islands. The largest donation was the Government of the Netherlands, which donated $15.2 million.
When Tropical Depression Thirteen became Tropical Storm Luis on August 29, it marked the earliest date of a seasons 12th named storm. While Luis was becoming extratropical it sped up to nearly 65 mph, making it the third fastest traveling Atlantic hurricane. On September 11 when Luis caused that 98 foot wave it was the highest wave recorded from an Atlantic hurricane. Until 2004, when Hurricane Ivan may have caused a wave up to 130 feet.

The name Luis was retired in the spring of 1996. Luis was the first name retired since Andrew in 1992. Luis was also the first named storm starting with L to get its name retired. Luis is now only one of two L names to get retired, the other was Lili in 2002. In 2001 Lorenzo was used instead.


Mossman, Queensland

Mossman is a town in north Queensland, Australia. It is on the Mossman River. There are about 1700 people living in Mossman. It was first called Mosman; the name was changed because there was a Sydney suburb called Mosman. Mossman is on the Captain Cook Highway, north of Cairns.

Mossman Gorge, a popular attraction in Daintree National Park, is located west of town. Sugar cane farming is a major crop around Mossman. The Mossman Central Mill is the only sugar mill in the area; turns the cane into sugar.
The Mossman area was served by 2 separate tram systems using 2 foot (610 mm) gauge tracks (width of track). The trams carried passengers and general goods, as well as sugar cane. These tramways were the first transport in the area, proper roads were built much later.

Mossman has 5 primary schools and one high school. Mossman was once part of the old Douglas Shire. It was also part of the Cairns Regional Council but has since left the council after protests, prompting the creation of the Douglas Shire Council. Mossman has a number of sporting clubs such as the Mossman Sharks rugby league club and the Port Douglas Australian Rules Football club.

Wim Jansen

Wilhelmus Marinus Antonius Jansen (; 28 October 1946 – 25 January 2022) was a Dutch professional football player and manager. As a midfielder or defender, he spent most of his career at Feyenoord, winning honours including the European Cup in 1970. He earned 65 international caps with the Dutch national team and played in the teams that reached the 1974 and 1978 FIFA World Cup finals. He was known for his exceptional vision, his mentality, ball-winning ability, stamina, and his defensive ability. He was considered irreplaceable. Widely regarded to be one of the best Dutch football players of all time.

He spent most of his playing career with his hometown team, Feyenoord, between 1965 and 1980. At Feyenoord, Jansen won four League Championships, one Dutch Cup, one UEFA Cup in 1974, and the European Cup in 1970 when Feyenoord defeated Celtic 2–1 in Milan. He was the captain of their 1974 team which defeated Tottenham Hotspur 4–2 on aggregate.

After a brief spell in the North American Soccer League with the Washington Diplomats, he moved to Feyenoord's rivals Ajax, where he won a league title in 1981–82. His debut for Ajax was against his former club in De Kuip in December 1980; a fan of Feyenoord threw an icy snowball at Jansen's eye during warming-up which finally resulted in Jansen being substituted within 20 minutes into the game.

Dutch teammate Johan Cruyff considered Jansen to be one of only four men worth paying attention to when they spoke about football.

Jansen earned his first of 65 caps for the Netherlands on 4 October 1967, in a 2–1 loss away to Denmark in UEFA Euro 1968 qualifying. He scored his only international goal in his eighth game on 4 September 1968, a 2–0 win over Luxembourg in his hometown for 1970 FIFA World Cup qualification.

Jansen played all seven games as the Dutch finished runners-up to hosts West Germany at the 1974 FIFA World Cup, and repeated the feat in 1978 as they lost to hosts Argentina. He committed the foul on Bernd Hölzenbein in 1974 which allowed Paul Breitner to equalise with a penalty as the Germans came from behind to beat the Dutch. He also played both games of their bronze-medal finish at UEFA Euro 1976 in Yugoslavia.

Jansen began his managerial career at his old club Feyenoord, where he worked as a coach, and then as assistant manager, between 1983 and 1987. He also had a season as manager of Belgian club SC Lokeren. In 1991, he returned to Feyenoord as manager, winning the KNVB Cup in 1991. The result was a surprise as the club had been near bankruptcy in the preceding years. 
The team also won the cup in 1992 and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1991–92. He became Technical Director in 1992, and his old teammate, Willem van Hanegem coached the team to the league in 1993 and the Dutch Cup again the following season. Jansen disagreed with van Hanegem's physical tactics, and argued with chairman Jorien van den Herik when the coach was given a contract extension. He left to work as assistant manager of Saudi Arabia alongside compatriot Leo Beenhakker, and also managed Japanese side Sanfrecce Hiroshima, where he struggled with the language.

On 3 July 1997, Wim Jansen was appointed head coach of Celtic, replacing the sacked Tommy Burns. He was their first manager from outside Great Britain and Ireland, and only the second to have never played for the club. He went on to guide them to their first Scottish league championship in ten years, ending the hopes of rival Rangers to win a tenth consecutive championship. Despite winning the league and the Scottish League Cup during his only season in charge, Jansen left the club less than 48 hours after the title was secured as he was unable to work with general manager Jock Brown. His most notable transfer was the signing of Henrik Larsson from Feyenoord.

At the beginning of the 2008–09 season, Jansen took up the position of assistant to the head coach of the Feyenoord first team, Gertjan Verbeek. He resigned in solidarity when the coach was fired in 2009.

Jansen and his family were not religious, and he would practice kicking a ball at a pole on Sundays while all his neighbours were at church. As a child, he lived on the same street ("Bloklandstraat"), just as Feyenoord teammate Coen Moulijn.

Jansen lived in Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht from the 1970s. In late 2021, he released the biography "Meesterbrein" ("Mastermind"), written alongside Yoeri van den Busken.

Jansen died on 25 January 2022 at his home in Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht, Netherlands from problems caused by dementia, aged 75.

Mission Beach, Queensland

Mission Beach is a small village along the Coral Sea in Queensland, Australia. Dunk Island, a popular tourist destination is away. It is in the tropical rainforest. Mission Beach is a good place to see the cassowary, an endangered flightless bird.

John Gould

John Gould (14 September 1804 – 3 February 1881) was an English ornithologist (bird scientist). The Gould League (a bird group) started in Australia in 1909, was named after him. His knowledge of the birds now called "Darwin's finches" was a turning point in the Charles Darwin's thinking about evolution by natural selection. They are barely mentioned in Charles Darwin's book, "On the Origin of Species".

Red-violet

Red-violet is a deep tone of rosy magenta. It may also be considered a reddish tone of purple or a bluish tone of rose.

On the old fashioned, now obsolete red-yellow-blue pigment color wheel (in which red, yellow, and blue were regarded as the primary colors and orange, green, and violet were regarded as the secondary colors), "red-violet" was a tertiary color between red and violet on the red-yellow-blue pigment color wheel and thus was the equivalent of pigment purple. The other tertiary colors on a red-yellow-blue (RYB) color wheel were called blue-violet, blue-green, yellow-green, yellow-orange, and red-orange.

The RYB color wheel is still often used to teach color to children.


It has been reported by ophthalmologists that those who have their lenses removed and replaced with clear plastic intraocular lenses can see partway into the ultraviolet and view electric purple (a tone of red-violet) on the spectrum beyond Violet because it has been shown that the retina has some ultraviolet sensitivity which is normally blocked by the natural lens. Presumably, tetrachromatic animals such as birds can also see this color on the spectrum. These observers able to see partially into the ultraviolet describe the color they can see beyond violet in the ultraviolet as a sort of lilac, that is, a reddish-violet (purple) color that is the color of the lilac flower. (Presumably this color that they see would be electric purple, since electric purple is a pure chroma on the color wheel and would presumably be the color we would see on the spectrum beyond violet if we could see into the ultraviolet.) 

Note: The spectrum colors can only be approximated on a computer screen but the colors shown below are a close approximation of the spectral colors red and violet, shown compared to the non-spectral color red-violet (a deep tone of the color magenta tending toward rose).

Thrush may mean:


Candidiasis

Candidiasis, often called yeast infection or thrush, is a type of infectious disease. It is a fungal infection (mycosis). The disease is caused by any of the "Candida" species of yeast. "Candida albicans" is the most common species.

"Candida" yeasts are common in most people. The yeast is usually controlled in the body. When the yeast grows without control, an infection happens.

A weakened, unhealthy, or young immune system may allow candidiasis to develop. HIV/AIDS, cancer treatments, steroids, stress and not enough nutrients may cause candidiasis.

Antibiotic and steroid use are the most common reason for uncontrolled yeast. Antibiotic kills some bacteria, and changes the balance of microorganisms in the body. This may allow the yeast to multiply.

Esophageal candidiasis is an infection of the esophagus by "Candida albicans". The disease happens in unhealthy people. Sometimes people will get the infection when they are treated with chemotherapy. People with AIDS can also get this infection more often.

One sign of esophageal candidiasis is painful swallowing. Weight loss can happen when a person has esophageal candidiasis for a long time.

Oral candidiasis is a yeast infection of the mouth. It is located on the mucous membranes of the mouth. It is caused by "Candida albicans", "Candida glabrata" or "Candida tropicalis".

Candida may appear as thick white or cream-coloured areas on mucosal membranes. The infected mucosa of the mouth may look inflamed. In babies the condition is called thrush. For babies, it is usually painless and causes no pain. Adults may experience discomfort or burning sensation.

In healthy persons, candidiasis is usually a very small infection of the skin or mucous membranes. These areas include:

Candidiasis is a very common cause of vaginal irritation, or vaginitis. It can also occur on the penis or scrotum. In unhealthy patients, the "Candida" infection can affect the esophagus. It could get everywhere in the body. This would cause a much more serious health condition, a state called candidemia.

Graphics processing unit

A graphics processing unit (GPU) is the processor on a graphics card. It makes images, animations, graphics and then displays them on the computer’s screen. A strong GPU is able to process complex animations and graphics smoothly and efficiently. Images which GPUs make may be 2D or 3D. For most applications, the GPU has to make two dimensional (2D) pictures. Some applications use 3D pictures to simulate three-dimensionality.

The first graphics processors were used in the 1970s in arcade machines. Graphics processors were not used for consumer products until the 1980s because they were too expensive to make. 

During the mid 1990s, graphics processors became common in arcade games, computer games and console games. The first GPU for personal computers was the Nvidia GeForce 256, released in 1999. It could calculate geometric objects in space and some lighting effects.

Nowadays, GPUs are always in personal computers, mobile telephones and video game systems. Most CPUs come with an internal GPU built-in. Those internal GPUs can make the visual effects of modern graphical user interfaces such as shadows, semi-transparent backgrounds and animations. However, for newer video games a more powerful additional dedicated GPU is usually needed.

Other devices such as virtual reality headsets and driverless cars also use GPUs. The tasks a GPU can do include technical calculations, Artificial Intelligence problem solving, photo editing and other applications.

The first attempts in Multi-GPU Systems were done by now defunct company 3Dfx in the late 1990s, which was bought by Nvidia later. Their "Voodoo" video cards, which were 3D only accelerators, could be hooked up to a second Voodoo video card to gain more performance. This was called SLi. Theoretically the performance would double, practically it increased far less, depending on the video game. Later, 3Dfx built even four GPUs on one unreleased video card.

1970 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1970 Atlantic hurricane season was the period of time in 1970 that tropical cyclones formed in Atlantic Ocean. It officially began on June 1, 1970, and it ended on November 30, 1970. Strong storms of 1970 include Hurricane Celia, which killed 20 people and caused severe damage. Also, Tropical Storm Dorothy killed 51 people, most in Martinique.

These are the names of the tropical cyclones that formed in the season:

These are the names set aside for 1970. Names that were not used are in .

After this season there was one name that got retired: Celia. In 1974, the name "Carmen" was used instead.

Gary Karr

Gary Karr (born 20 November 1941), is an American classical double bass virtuoso and teacher.
There were several double bass players in his family, but he did not meet them. He studied with several teachers. He went to the Juilliard School. In 1962 he became famous when he was a soloist in a nationally televised New York Philharmonic Young People's Concert, conducted by Leonard Bernstein. On that famous telecast, Karr performed "The Swan" from "Carnival of the Animals" by Camille Saint-Saëns.

Gary Karr has given performances in many parts of the world. He has published a number of books for learning to play the double bass. After 40 years as a concert artist he retired in 2001 to Victoria, British Columbia, where he lives with his dog Shin-Ju.

In 1967, Karr founded the International Society of Bassists (ISB), an organization which encourages the playing of the double bass all over the world. Every two years the ISB has a big international conference. 

Olga Koussevitzky, widow of the conductor and double bass player Serge Koussevitzky (1874-1951) heard Karr play when he was young, and gave him the beautiful Amati double bass made in 1611 which her husband had played. Karr later gave this double bass to the ISB so that double bassists world-wide could play on it. 

In 1984 the Karr Doublebass Foundation was established by Karr, which loans instruments to promising young double bassists to help them in their careers. 

1996 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1996 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1996, and lasted until November 30, 1996. Tropical Cyclones can and have formed outside these dates but not in 1996, because Hurricane Marco ended on November 24. The 1996 Atlantic hurricane season was very active, but not as active as 1995, but it was more active then 1997.

Tropical Storm Arthur was the first tropical storm of the 1996 season. It started on June 17 in the Bahamas as Tropical Depression One. One became Tropical Storm Arthur late on June 19. Tropical Storm Arthur made landfall in Cape Lookout, North Carolina was a weak tropical storm. It moved to the east and went back into the Atlantic Ocean and died on June 21. Arthur killed no one and caused only $1 million in damage.

Hurricane Bertha was the first hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season. It started on July 5 near the Cape Verde Islands. On that same day it became Tropical Storm Bertha. By July 7 it became a hurricane, during that day it struck Antigua, and Sint Maarten. Bertha moved along the edges of the islands in the Bahamas. Hurricane Bertha made landfall in North Carolina on July 12 as a category 2 hurricane. It quickly got weaker and died on July 14 as it entered Canada. Bertha killed 9 people and caused $335 million in damage. 
Hurricane Cesar started off the coast of Venezuela on July 24, it was a tropical depression at this time. It slowly got stronger, becoming a tropical storm the next day and a hurricane by July 27. On July 28 it made landfall as a hurricane in Nicaragua. Cesar weakened to a tropical storm over land, but it reached the Pacific Ocean and later on it became Hurricane Douglas. Hurricane Cesar killed 77 people and caused $206 million in damage.

Hurricane Dolly started as Tropical Depression Four near Jamaica. It got stronger and it became Tropical Storm Dolly soon after. Tropical Storm Dolly became Hurricane Dolly just before it made landfall in the Yucatan Peninsula on August 20. It weakened over land and entered the southern Gulf of Mexico as a tropical depression. Dolly quickly got stronger again and became a tropical storm. Just before it made another landfall in Mexico, it became Hurricane Dolly again on August 23. The storm weakened a lot over Mexico and it died on August 26. It killed about 14 in Mexico.

Hurricane Edouard was the strongest hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season. It started as Tropical Depression Five near Cape Verde on August 19. Tropical Depression Five did not become Tropical Storm Edouard until August 22. By the next day it had gotten stronger and it was Hurricane Edouard at this point. 

Hurricane Edouard strengthened fast, peaking as a category 4 hurricane on from August 24 - 28. After this, it weakened slightly, back to a category 3 hurricane. It turned to the north and repeated this but did not again re-strengthen into a category 4 hurricane. On September 2, Hurricane Edouard passed only 90 miles to the south of Massachusetts. By the next day Hurricane Edouard had died. 

Edouard killed 2 people and caused around $3.5 million in damage.

Fran started on August 23 as Tropical Depression Six. It slowly got stronger because Hurricane Edouard was near it. The depression became Tropical Storm Fran on August 27. Fran became a hurricane on August 29, weakened back to a tropical storm on August 30, and became a hurricane again on August 31. Hurricane Fran did not get much stronger until it began on a track more to the north. By September 5, it made landfall in Cape Fear, North Carolina as a category 3 hurricane. It died on September 8. Fran caused the deaths of 26 people and caused $3.2 billion in damage.
On August 26, Tropical Depression Seven started. It slowly grew and became Tropical Storm Gustav. It headed northwest and did not get any stronger because of the large size of Hurricane Fran and wind shear. Wind shear also caused in to die on September 2.

Hortense started on September 3 as the eighth tropical depression in 1996 in the Atlantic. It slowly strengthened, becoming Tropical Storm Hortense on September 7, four days later. As a tropical storm, it passed into the Leeward Islands and entered the Caribbean Sea. Continuing to slowly strengthen, it became Hurricane Hortense on September 9. Hurricane Hortense made landfall on the southwestern part of Puerto Rico. This resulted in $155 million in damage and the deaths of 18 people. It also moved along the coast of Dominican Republic, which killed 3 people. 

It soon re-entered the Atlantic Ocean, and it quickly strengthened. By September 13, it had become a 140 miles per hour, category 4 hurricane. Hortense started moving faster, but weakened at the same time. Finally, by September 15 it had made another landfall in Nova Scotia. In Nova Scotia, there was $3 million in damage. Hurricane Hortense died on later on September 15.

Isidore started on September 24 a few hundred miles south of Cape Verde. It headed westward and later peaked as a category 3 hurricane. Hurricane Isidore began heading north after it became a category 3 hurricane. Isidore weakened and died on October 1. 

The 1996 Atlantic hurricane season had 4 tropical storms, 3 hurricane, 6 major hurricanes and 1 possible storm.

There were 8 unused names in 1996 they include:

In the spring of 1997 the following names got retired: "Cesar, Fran and Hortense" and there are replaced by "Cristobal, Fay and Hanna" for the 2002 season.

Nilotic peoples

Nilotic is a word that refers to a number of people who speak Nilotic languages. Today they live in Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia. Most of them are farmers, raising cattle.

Roman Patkoló

Roman Patkoló (born 6 February 1982 in Zilina, Slovakia) is a Slovak virtuoso double bass player.

Patkoló started to play the double bass when he was only 13. This is quite a young age to play the double bass which is a very large instrument. He soon showed his amazing talent and two years later won 1st prize in the National Slovak Competition.

Since then he has won many other competitions, including the International Double Bass Competition in 1999 in Iowa, USA. The following year he won the Johannes Matthias Sperger International Music Competition, which is the world’s most famous competition for double bass playing. Many other prizes followed. He finished his studies in Munich in 2005.

He got a scholarship from the foundation organized by the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter. This foundation has encouraged several composers to write new solo works for the double bass. Mutter’s husband, the conductor Sir André Previn, composed a concerto for violin, double bass and orchestra, which was first performed in 2007 by the Boston Symphony Orchestra with Previn conducting and Mutter and Patkoló as soloists.

A notable recent collaboration is with composer . Their performance of Gelgotas' Sanctifaction premiered in February 2018 with publications by the Gramophone Magazine and the Strad. In June 2018 both musicians performed live on BR Klassik.

Roman Patkoló was named as one of five instrumentalists of the year by Opus Klassik award (succeeding Echo Klassik) in Germany in 2018.

Patkoló is asked to perform all over the world. He now teaches at the University of Music Basel.

Healesville Sanctuary

Healesville Sanctuary, or the Sir Colin MacKenzie Fauna Park, is a zoo at Healesville in Victoria. It only keeps animals that come from Australia. It has a history of breeding Australian animals. In 1943 it became the first zoo to breed a platypus. The only other zoo to have bred a platypus is Sydney's Taronga Zoo. It also helps by breeding the endangered Helmeted honeyeater. It is one of three zoos in Victoria run by Zoos Victoria; the others are the Melbourne Zoo and the Werribee Open Range Zoo.

The zoo is in a natural bush setting. Paths wind through different habitat areas with wallabies, wombats, dingoes, kangaroos, and over 200 Australian birds. There are tours, bird shows and information areas for visitors.

Dr Colin MacKenzie (knighted in 1929) set up the "Institute of Anatomical Research" in 1921. It was on of land which had been part of the Coranderrk Aboriginal Reserve. The Reserve was given to the Healesville Council in 1927. It became the "Sir Colin MacKenzie Sanctuary" in 1934. By 1947 the sanctuary had grown into a major tourist attraction and the management was taken over by the Victorian government. Since then the zoo has grown with new special features and facilites including the $6 million Australian Wildlife Health Centre in 2005.

The Healesville Sanctuary is currently working on breeding programs for endangered species including the: 

Tropical Storm Barry (2007)

Tropical Storm Barry was a tropical cyclone that grew quickly. It made landfall in Florida in early June 2007. It was the second Atlantic named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. Barry formed in the Gulf of Mexico and moved toward the northeast, reaching top wind speeds of 60 mph (95 km/h). It then weakened and first reached land near Tampa Bay, Florida. Barry quickly weakened after wind shear blew away most of the thunderstorms. Barry moved up the East Coast of the United States, and by June 5, it was taken over by an even bigger storm.

Rain from Barry in the Cuban province of Pinar del Río hurt three people and damaged 55 houses. In Florida, Barry caused heavy rain in an area that had been in a drought. Flooding and wet roads killed two people in traffic accidents. Rough seas killed one surfer in Pinellas County, Florida. In Florida and Georgia, the rain helped firefighters fight wildfires. Damage from the storm was minor.

On May 29, a weather system in the Yucatán Peninsula created a small area of thunderstorms over the Yucatán Channel. The thunderstorms got stronger near the weather system. By May 30, clouds from the area reached from Nicaragua to the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. Another weather system, called a tropical wave, created a storm on May 30. The next day, a cyclone formed inside the system. The storm moved towards the north-northeast, and slowly gained strength. More thunderstorms formed near the center, and the system became a tropical depression. A tropical depression is a type of storm.

The depression developed an area of squalls (sudden, violent storms with wind and rain). A Hurricane Hunters airplane flew into the area to collect information about the cyclone. At the beginning, the tropical depression looked to be both a tropical and subtropical cyclone. On June 1, the National Hurricane Center named the storm "Tropical Storm Barry". Barry was now 235 miles (375 km) to the west of Key West, Florida. Barry moved quickly towards the north. On June 2, it reached its strongest with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h).

After Barry reached its maximum strength, strong wind shear removed most of the thunderstorms from the tropical cyclone. The center of the system then increased in length, and it began to weaken. At 1400 UTC on June 2, Barry made landfall near Tampa, Florida while it was at tropical depression status. As Barry moved inland, it weakened more. Later that day, the National Hurricane Center said that Barry had died out over northeastern Florida. What was left of Barry continued to move northeast. On June 3, it moved onto shore again, this time in South Carolina. Late on June 4, the extratropical system entered New England. Late on June 5, what was left of the cyclone was taken over by a larger weather system, near the border of the U.S. state of Maine and the Canadian province of Quebec.

When Barry was named as a tropical storm, the National Hurricane Center sent out a tropical storm warning for the west coast of Florida from Bonita Beach through Keaton Beach. Also, a tropical storm watch was issued from Keaton Beach, northward to Saint Marks. An inland tropical storm warning was also sent out for inland parts of Charlotte, Citrus, DeSoto, Hardee, Hernando, Highlands, Lee, Levy, Manatee, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Sarasota, and Sumter counties. The storm increased the risk of rip currents, so officials told swimmers to stay out of the water until the storm left the area. A tornado watch was sent out for the southern part of the state, but it was removed after the storm lost strength.

After Barry became an extratropical cyclone, National Weather Service offices sent out flood watches for parts of: South Carolina, eastern North Carolina, southeastern Virginia, and southeastern Maryland.
Flood watches were also sent out for: southeast Pennsylvania, northern Delaware, northern New Jersey, east-central New York, southern New England. 
A wind advisory was sent out for parts of Georgia.

Barry caused heavy rain in Florida. The heaviest rain was 6.99 inches (178 mm) at Palm Beach International Airport. Other areas reported over 3 inches (75 mm) of rain. The rain helped to get rid of drought conditions. It also helped in fighting bad wildfires across the state. In Brevard County, the rain caused a large sinkhole, a hole in the ground, to open in the middle of a road. Other roads were flooded. On Interstate 95, near Lake Worth, another sinkhole closed two lanes of traffic. Wet slippery roads caused many traffic accidents in the state. In Brevard and Volusia counties, drivers were killed in traffic accidents. On Interstate 4, a tractor trailer crashed into a guardrail because of the weather.

The storm caused stormy seas along the coastline of Florida, with a storm surge of 4.78 feet (1.46 m) at Clearwater Beach. The waves caused minor beach erosion. The high surge also caused minor flooding on many roads near Tampa Bay. At Indian Shores, a woman died after being injured by the high seas.

Barry caused high winds in Florida, which reached 47 mph (76 km/h), near the southeastern coastline of the state. The winds knocked down trees and caused power failures. In Carrolwood, one person was injured when a tree crashed onto their house. The storm created at least two tornadoes, including some that damaged fences and power lines. One possible tornado in Goulds, Florida left about 2,000 people without power.

The storm also caused heavy rain in Georgia of up to 8 inches (203 mm). The rain helped put out wildfires. It also caused some minor flooding, and in Savannah, there were a few minor car accidents. Winds blew down some trees and power lines. Heavy rain from the storm moved across much of the East Coast of the United States. High winds also occurred in South Carolina.

The remains of Barry caused strong winds along the Atlantic coast. They reached 60 mph (97 km/h) near Charleston, South Carolina. Around 200 houses in Craven County, North Carolina lost power. In southeastern Virginia, the storm caused over 60 traffic accidents. Ten people were injured in them. High seas off Cape Fear left a sailboat with three people needing rescue from the Coast Guard.

Rain went north into the Mid-Atlantic States and New England, with 4.50 inches (113 mm) at Absecon, New Jersey, 3.91 inches (99 mm) near Central Park, New York, and 3.19 inches (81 mm) at Taunton, Massachusetts. Flooding damaged several roads and driveways in the Finger Lakes region of New York State. Flash floods were seen in southeast New York, and high wind gusts caused some damage to trees. In New Jersey, winds pushing over land caused high tides and minor coastal flooding.


2009 Atlantic hurricane season

The 2009 Atlantic hurricane season was a time period of 2009 when tropical cyclones were likely form in the Atlantic Ocean. The season started on June 1, 2009 and it ended on November 30, 2009. In this season Tropical Depression One formed early, on May 28. In June and July there were no storms. The most recent occurrence of no storms in June or July was in 1992. In total there were 2 tropical depressions, 7 tropical storms, 3 hurricanes, and two of the three were major hurricanes.

On May 28, a small storm formed off the coast of North Carolina and became a tropical depression, called "One" by the National Hurricane Center. The National Hurricane Center said that Tropical Depression One might strengthen into a tropical storm, but it did not because the water was cold and did not give enough energy to the storm. It weakened and stopped being a depression the next day.
Tropical Depression Two formed on August 11 south of Cape Verde. The system moved west and dissipated on August 13. On August 15 the remains of Tropical Depression Two reformed. Tropical Depression Two quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Ana. The storm continued west towards the Leeward Islands. A few days later as the storm was still headed for the Leeward Islands it weakened to a tropical depression. Ana struck Dominica on August 16 and dissipated the next day.

On August 15, Tropical Depression Three formed and quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Bill. On August 17 Tropical Storm Bill became Hurricane Bill. On August 18 Hurricane Bill became a major hurricane (Category 3+). Hurricane Bill quickly strengthened into a category 4 hurricane on August 19, but weakened back on to a category 3 on August 20. Hurricane Bill weakened to a category 2 on August 21, it again weakened the next day to a category 1 hurricane. As a category one hurricane Bill came close to a landfall in Nova Scotia. Near midnight (Eastern Time Zone) on August 23, Bill made landfall in Newfoundland and became extratropical the next day. The remains affected United Kingdom.
Tropical Storm Claudette formed in the Gulf of Mexico as Tropical Depression Four early on August 16. At 12:15 p.m. EDT the same day, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Claudette. Early the next morning Claudette struck Santa Rosa Island, Florida. Tropical Storm Claudette weakened and dissipated on August 18.
Tropical Storm Danny formed north of Puerto Rico on August 26. Danny top winds were at 60 mph. Danny did not become a hurricane. Danny instead, moved toward North Carolina as a weak tropical storm. On August 29 Danny weaken into a depression and lost it clouds to an extratropical storm. Danny did not reach North Carolina before losing its cloud. Danny killed a boy in North Carolina due to rip currents.
Tropical Storm Erika formed on September 1 as Tropical Storm Erika, meaning it was never a tropical depression. Tropical Storm Erika moved mostly west for most of the lifespan of it. On September 2 Tropical Storm Erika made landfall in Guadeloupe. Tropical Storm Erika weaken to a tropical depression and a remnant low on September 3. The remnant low caused some rain to some of the northern islands of the Caribbean Sea.

Tropical Depression Seven formed on September 7 south of the Cape Verde Islands. Later on September 7 it became a tropical storm and was named Fred. Early the next day, Tropical Storm Fred became Hurricane Fred, the second hurricane of the season. Hurricane Fred became a major hurricane (Cat 3+). Fred slowly weakened after becoming a category 3 hurricane. On September 12 while a tropical storm, Fred became a remnant low and is no longer a tropical storm.
Tropical Depression Eight formed near Cape Verde on September 25. Tropical Depression Eight was said that it would become a tropical storm, this did not happen. Tropical Depression Eight instead became a tropical wave on September 26. It is no longer a tropical depression.
Tropical Storm Grace became a tropical storm late on October 4, it was also never a tropical depression while it was forming. Tropical Storm Grace moved towards Ireland, but went into a frontal system on October 5, Grace was not a tropical storm anymore. The remains affect Ireland and the United Kingdom.

Tropical Storm Henri was a weak storm that stayed out in the ocean for most of its life. It formed from a tropical wave on October 6 while moving northwest across the Atlantic. On the next day, wind shear around the storm caused it to weaken into a remnant low. Its remains were last seen near Cuba. The storm did not come close to any land and did not cause any damage to property.
On November 4, Tropical Depression Eleven started in the Caribbean Sea. Later that same day it became a tropical storm and was given the name "Ida". Ida became a hurricane just before landfall on November 5. Ida weakened fast over land and was a depression before the end of the day. On November 6, Ida came back into the Caribbean Sea just north of Honduras. Ida became a tropical storm again on November 7. Ida later on became a hurricane again and weakened back to a tropical storm on November 9. Ida made landfall in Alabama on November 10. The storm died only about 4 hours later. The remains of Ida became a nor'easter that killed 9 people. Hurricane Ida also caused about $5.6 million in damage.
The following names will be used for named storms that form in the North Atlantic in 2009. This is the same list that was used in the 2003 season, except for "Fred", "Ida", and "Joaquin". In 2003 those three names were Fabian, Isabel, and Juan, because they were bad storms in 2003, their names were retired from the list of names.



Tropical Depression Seven (2003)

Tropical Depression Seven was a weak tropical depression that formed near the northeast Florida coast. It was the seventh tropical cyclone of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. The depression formed on July 25 from the same tropical wave that created another weather system. It was a small and disorganized depression, and it never became a tropical storm, which is stronger than a tropical depression. The depression moved onto land at St. Catherines Island, Georgia, and it quickly weakened. Because the storm was weak, the effects were limited to heavy rain in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.

A tropical wave, which had also created Tropical Depression Six, combined itself with an upper-level low pressure area to create an area of deep convection near Hispaniola on July 23, 2003. A mid- to lower-level circulation started to form inside the storm as it moved mostly in a north-northwest direction. According to surface and satellite observations, it is thought that the system became Tropical Depression Seven at 1200 UTC on July 25 about 60 miles (95 km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida. The system was caught in an environment characterized by high surface pressures.

At first, the depression moved west-northwest at about 13 mph (20 km/h), and most of the convection from the storm was separated from the center. However, the cloud pattern became organized, and was made up of a number of curved banding features. The storm continued to move northwestward for its whole life, from the steering currents of a subtropical ridge and an approaching mid-level trough.

Moving through an area of cool water temperatures, as well as unfavorable upper-level winds, the depression was not able to get winds greater than 35 mph (55 km/h), and as a result did not gain tropical storm status. Before landfall, the highest winds were measured to exist in a small area northeast of the center of circulation, where a well-defined group of clouds persisted. Early on July 26, it moved onto land on St. Catherines Island, Georgia, and after slowly weakening over land, it died out on July 27.

The depression was never predicted to become tropical storm status. Because of this, no tropical storm warnings or watches were issued. However, flood watches were issued for part of Georgia and South Carolina. At Georgetown County, South Carolina, officials watched the storm closely. 

The depression dropped light to moderate rain from Florida to the coast of North Carolina. The highest rain was 5.17 inches (131 mm) in Savannah, Georgia. Other rainfall totals of 2 to 3 in (50 to 75 mm) were common. There were no damages or casualties because of this depression.

Kero Kero Keroppi

Keroppi is a Japanese frog character. He was created in 1987 by the Japanese company Sanrio. The first sales were in June 1988. He won first place in a popularity vote by Sanrio in 1990. He lives in Doughnut Pond with his siblings Koroppi and Picky. His father is a doctor and his mother runs a small restaurant. Keroppi likes his mother's rice. He has a girlfriend named Keroleen. His birthday is July 23. He likes adventuring, and his talents are swimming and singing. He is a decently popular character, not yet reaching Hello Kitty or Gudetama levels though. 

Know Your Lore: Keroppi
Alex Ziebart
Owner

Keroppi sits upon his cursed throne. Neither Keroppi nor throne pictured here.
When word came from upstairs that we were switching over to HKO Insider, I was afraid that was the end of Know Your Lore. It turns out, HKO's lore is far superior to Warcraft's lore. For one thing, Hello Kitty is consistent. For two, it is adorable. For three, it has hit the perfect mix of humor and drama, something that WoW could never, ever do.

I've personally fallen in love with a character that goes by the name of Keroppi. The name Keroppi originates from the sound frogs are said to make in Japan, 'kero,' and the word 'ppi' which means 'giant leaps bring faith and forgiveness to all men'. Keroppi comes from a relatively large, well-rounded family. His father is a doctor, his mother is a chef, and he is one out of a set of non-identical triplets. He and his siblings, Koroppi and Pikki, are all very unique from one another in all but appearance. In fact, Koroppi(meaning 'holy crap they look the same' and 'no seriously') and Keroppi are often mistaken for one another, which certainly doesn't make life in the region of Donut Pond very easy.

As a boy, Keroppi was a smart, studious frog. Keroppi and his brother, Koroppi, were the smart ones of Donut Pond, always envied by the other kids of the city. Keroppi was even a bit of an overachiever, taking swimming and singing lessons in his spare time. Their father, Keroppa, had very high hopes for the boys. He is praised across the globe as the world's most brilliant doctor and surgeon. Keroppa is believed to be able to cure any illness or ailment, and it was his belief that these boys could surpass even him.

Pikki isn't exactly on the academic level of Keroppi and Koroppi, but she's still a very intelligent girl. More importantly, she is hot. I mean, wow! This isn't about that, though. Like the boys take after their father, Pikki takes after their mother, Keroma. She is training to be a master chef and take over the family restaurant, and she has already earned the love of the locals for her masterwork: Kerocakes. They're pancakes, but with more kero.

Unfortunately for Pikki, it turns out that the Kerocake recipe isn't a Kerokero Family creation, as Keroma claimed. The Kerokero Family's American rivals, the trio known as "Boo Gey Woo" created the Kerocakes to bring the taste of Donut Pond to the American Southwest. Keroppi's grandparents, Kerojee and Kerobah, knew instantly that this was infringing on their Kerokero trademark, but also knew that a drawn out court case over the Kerocakes would harm their reputation in the long run. They took matters into their own hands and hired Furui Badtz-Maru, grandfather of Badtz-Maru, to steal the Kerocakes recipe from the Boo Gey Woo trio, so the Kerokero Family could make it their own.

Now, two generations later, the Boo Gey Woo trio have made the presence known once more: They kidnapped Pikki, and have taken back the Kerocakes recipe. The Kerokero Family keeps the reasons for Pikki's kidnapping a secret, to prevent the locals from discovering the truth and ruining their family business. Moreover, it would ruin Keroppa's reputation as a respectable doctor, something that could rock the very foundation of the world, heralding a resurgence of disease and death.

Keroppi, unable to tolerate the growing hopelessness of the situation, gathers two unlikely heroes from Donut Pond: Kyorosuke, an amazingly tall frog blessed with incredible vision, and Ganta, a short but powerful frog with the ability to turn himself into a rock. Together, these three form the Ganta-Kyorosuke-Keroppi Gang. United, the three of them acted against the Boo Gey Woo trio from the shadows, thwarting many attempts made by the BGW to dominate and control the culinary world, building up to one final battle to retrieve Pikki and restore the Kerokero Family's rightful place as Iron Chefs.

It took nearly a year to meet Keroppi's ultimate goal. Ganta, Kyorosuke and Keroppi reached the American Southwest to finally face down the Boo Gey Woo, and the battle was horrifying. The BGW were ruthless, using anything and everything for an edge, including threatening the death of poor Pikki. Ganta, ever-brave, called the pig trio's bluff. Boo Gey Woo weren't to be toyed with, and did not hesitate to make the most of this opportunity. Together, they turned to strike at the beautiful young frogwoman, but Keroppi would have none of that. With a great shout which caused the ground itself to tremble, Keroppi summoned up every ounce of qi in his body and called up an ancient power held within the Kerokero Family: The Kage Bunshin no Jutsu. Keroppi hopped with such speed and strength that one frog seemed to be ten! Then twenty! Fourty! One hundred frogs! The Boo Gey Woo ran in fear, and Pikki was saved.

Keroppi, Ganta and Kyorosuke returned to Donut Pond with the city's beloved Pikki, who was welcomed with open arms. Unfortunately for the Ganta-Kyorosuke-Keroppi Gang, during their crusade against the Boo Gey Woo, they were expelled from school due to extended absences. The Kerokero Family, considering this a black mark on their reputation, exiled Keroppi from the family and have worked since then to remove him from this history entirely.

Keroppi, disgusted with the power of reputation and society at large, has since departed Pond Lake and has taken up residence on an offshore island. His allies, Ganta and Kyorosuke, have remained on the mainland to siphon funds from the defeated Boo Gey Woo's bank accounts illegally, redirecting the money to Keroppi. Keroppi has begun using these funds to research methods of growing super sized lily pads, which he intends to use to crush Donut Pond, thus beginning a new world. A world with all of the joys of this one, and none of the hatreds. A world of equality, where the Kerokero Family will be reborn and live in peace.

This is where Hello Kitty Online began, and rumor has it that Keroppi and the next chapter of his story will be the focus of Hello Kitty Island Adventures alongside Badtz-Maru, grandson of the man who stole the Kerocakes recipe, and they will be the final bosses of the expansion. Better round up 24 of your closest friends, I'm willing to bet Keroppi's pinks will be truly amazing. Remember, watch out for his Kage Bunshin!

Methane hydrate

Methane hydrate, also called methane ice or methane clathrate, consists of methane, which is enclosed in frozen water. The water molecules completely surround the methane. Methane hydrate is a common constituent of the shallow marine (ocean) geosphere. In 1971, it was first discovered in Black Sea.

Methane hydrate consists of methane gas trapped inside cage-like crystal structures made up of water molecules. These “cages” have a size of atoms and molecules, far too small to see with the naked eye. Under normal temperature and pressure, one litre of methane hydrate is equal to 168 litres of methane gas.

Methane hydrate is thought to be formed by dead organic matter trapped between the earth's layers, and then broken down by microorganisms and the earth's heat. The process is similar to the one that produces methane when organic waste is dumped at a garbage pit and covered with earth, except that it occurs deep below the earth's surface. The organisms which produce methane by a process of fermentation are the methaneogen Archea.

Areas where natural methane hydrate is thought to exist are generally areas under the ocean where continental plates meet. In depths between 500 to 1000 meter, where pressure is high and temperature low enough.

It opened on August 5, 1925, and famous people like boxer Jack Dempsey and silent film actor Rudolph Valentino were there.

In the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s it was home to some of the biggest boxing, wrestling and roller derby events.

The 1960s and 1970s were a major boom period for the Olympic Auditorium, as major wrestling events were held at the arena every other Friday night. It was the home of the T-Birds, who played a game called "Roller Derby". In the late 1980s it was changed and 3,000 seats were taken out, leaving space for about 7,500.

Some scenes from the movie "Rocky" were filmed there.

In June 2005, the Glory Church of Jesus Christ, a Korean-American Christian church, bought the entire property and changed the name. In 2007, the arena was painted brown like it used to be.

Hydrography

Hydrography is a subject of Geography. It concerns itself with measuring the physical characteristics of waters, such as rivers, lakes and oceans. It can also be about such measurement in navigable waters, as they are necessary for the safe passage of ships and vessels.

Massive hydrographical studies are usually undertaken by national or international organizations that sponsor data collection through surveys and publication of charts and descriptive materials for navigational purposes. 

Hydrography's origin lies in the making of chart like drawings and notations made by individual mariners. It was usually a private property, even closely held secrets, used for commercial or military advantage.


Pluviometry

Pluviometry is a field of meteorology concerned with the measurement of rainfall. The word comes from the Latin word "pluvius" which means "rain", and the Greek word "metron (μέτρον)", meaning "measure". The amount of rain can be measured in a rain gauge, or pluviometer.

Doctor of Law

Doctor of Law or Doctor of Laws is a degree in law. The term varies from country to country, and includes degrees such as the Doctor of Juridical Science (J.S.D. or S.J.D), Doctor juris (Dr. iur. or Dr. jur.), Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), Juris Doctor (J.D.), and Legum Doctor (LL.D.).

In the United States and Canada, a Juris Doctor is a degree in law. Along with a Doctor of Medicine degree for physicians, a Juris Doctor Degree is also a professional degree, which is required by law to become a licensed lawyer. 

Waldsassen

Waldsassen is a town in Tirschenreuth in the Upper Palatinate in Bavaria.

Waldsassen is the northernmost municipality of the Upper Palatinate. In the northeast, it borders the town of Cheb ("Eger") in the Czech Republic. The historic tripoint of noble Altbayern, the Franconian lands of Bayreuth, and the Bohemian Egerland is near the village of Pechtnersreuth.
Waldsassen is twinned with:



Plaintiff

A plaintiff is a person who starts a lawsuit in court. Sometimes a plaintiff will have to fill out a form called a summons, claim form, or complaint. This document tells what the person they are suing (the defendant) did. If the case is a criminal case and not a lawsuit, the plaintiff can be called a complainant.

Defendant

A defendant is the person or group of people who comes to court because of a complaint by a plaintiff. A defendant may also be called a respondent, if a petition is used against them to make them come to court.

Game Boy Player

The Game Boy Player is a device for the Nintendo GameCube console that allows a person to be able to play Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance video games on the console. It was released in Japan, North America, and Europe in June 2003 and discontinued in 2007.

Tibor Sekelj

Tibor Sekelj (in Hungarian: "Székely Tibor") (14 February 1912 – 20 September 1988) was an explorer, writer and lawyer. He traveled a lot in South America, Africa and Asia. He spoke many languages, including Esperanto, the made up international language. He was member of the Academy of Esperanto and honorary member of the Universal Association of Esperanto (UEA). He wrote books in Esperanto. He came from a Jewish family.

Sekelj was born in Spišská Sobota, which was then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It is now called Poprad, in Slovakia. His father was a veterinarian (animal doctor), and the family moved around extensively. They moved to Cheney, now in Romania. In 1922 they moved to Kikinda, Serbia. He went to elementary school in Kikinda. The family moved to Nikšić, in Montenegro where he finished high school. He went to Zagreb where he studied in law at university.

Disinterested in practicing law, he began working as a journalist in Zagreb. In 1939 he went to Argentina to write about former Croates who had left Yugoslavia to settle in South America. He stayed there for the next 15 years as a journalist and explorer. In 1944 he was part of a trekking party that climbed to the top of highest mountain in the western hemisphere Aconcagua , near Argentina. He used this experience to write a novel (story) in Spanish about Aconcagua, which became a best seller there. In 1946 he undertook the first of two expeditions into the Amazon jungle, the first of which produced a popular book, (Por Tierra De Indios). His companion from that expedition, Mary Reznik—whom he later married—was the first white woman to have penetrated that deeply into the Brazilian jungle. Together they returned to the Amazon in 1948, after which he penned "Where Civilization Ends" (Donde La Civilizacion Termina). The marriage produced a son, Diego. In 1954 Sekelj returned to Yugoslavia and settled in Belgrade, although he still traveled extensively. In 1962 he traveled through Africa. He married Erzsebet Sekelj, a young woman he met on a trip through Hungary. From 1972 he lived in Subotica (Vojvodina), now in Serbia. He was in charge of a museum in Subotica. He died in Subotica, and is buried there.




During his travels in South America, Africa, Asia, Oceania, Sekelj collected many important items from other cultures. He gave these to the Ethnographic Museum of Zagreb.

His main book on other cultures is " Tirez the arrow: oral poetry of the world ", Rotterdam: UEA, 1983, 187 pages, . He translated into Esperanto, the poetry he had collected during his travels.

Sekelj worked with many other writers on a dictionary of museums, called the "Dictionarium Museologicum", 1986.

Nintendo DSi

The is the third version of the Nintendo DS handheld. It was first announced in October 2008 and was available in Japan in November of the same year and worldwide in 2009/2010. Development of the DSi began in late 2006, shortly after the release of the DS Lite. A larger version of the DSi titled the Nintendo DSi XL was released in 2009/2010.

The DSi is about 12% thinner (2.6 mm) and the screen is about 17% bigger than the Nintendo DS Lite. It has two Video Graphics Array (or VGA) 0.3 megapixel digital cameras; one is pointed at the user and the other is in the outer shell. The power switch is now a power button like the original Nintendo DS instead of a switch and is moved to the bottom to make it harder to bump by accident. It no longer has a slot to play Game Boy Advance games in and one will not be able to play games such as "" on the DSi because the game requires the slot and the download games.



Charles IV of Spain

Charles IV (11 November 1748 – 20 January 1819) was King of Spain from 14 December 1788 until his abdication on 19 March 1808. Later that year, Joseph Bonaparte became king.

Charles IV married his first cousin Princess Maria Luisa, the daughter of Philip, Duke of Parma, in 1765. The couple had fourteen children, six of whom survived into adulthood:



Tapestry

Tapestry is art made with threads. It is woven by hand on a vertical loom. It is weft-faced weaving. This means all the warp threads (the ones that go up and down) are hidden in the completed work. In normal cloth weaving both the warp and the weft threads can be seen. 

In this way, a colourful pattern or image is made. Most weavers use a natural warp thread such as linen or cotton. The weft threads, which will be seen, are usually wool or cotton. They can also be made of silk, gold, silver, or other things.

Both craftsmen and artists have made tapestries. The 'blueprints' on cardboard (also known as 'tapestry cartoons') were made by artists, while actual weaving of the tapestries was done by craftsmen.

The success of decorative tapestry can be partially explained by its portability (Le Corbusier once called tapestries "nomadic murals"). Kings and noblemen could roll up and transport tapestries from one residence to another. In churches, they were displayed on special occasions. Tapestries were also draped on the walls of castles for insulation during winter, as well as for decorative display.

The famous Bayeux tapestry is not actually a tapestry, but a decorated cloth. And it was probably designed and made in England by Anglo-Saxon artists.

Critically endangered species

A critically endangered species is a species of plant or animal, that has an extremely high risk of extinction in the future.

Kenichi Uemura

Uemura was born in Yatsushiro on April 22, 1974. After graduating from Matsunaga High School, he joined J1 League side Sanfrecce Hiroshima in 1993. The club won the 2nd place in 1994 J1 League and 1995, 1996 and 1999 Emperor's Cup. He played in many matches as defender from his first season, except at times when he was injured.

After 11 year's long service at Sanfrecce Hiroshima, he moved to Cerezo Osaka in 2004, then Tokyo Verdy (2005–2006). After a brief spell at YSCC Yokohama, he joined his local club Rosso Kumamoto (later "Roasso Kumamoto") in 2007. He damaged his knee ligaments three times and experienced seven operations. These injuries have affected his form. Uemura retired from professional football after the 2008 season.

He represented the Japan U-23 national team at the 1996 Summer Olympics. He played in 2 matches. He scored a goal in a group stage match against Hungary. Although Japan won 2 matches, Japan exited in the first round. Japan beat Brazil in their first game. It was known as the "Miracle of Miami" () in Japan.

In April 2001, Uemura was selected by the Japan national team. National team manager Philippe Troussier gave him his first full international cap on April 25 in a friendly against Spain. He was a member of the Japan team for the 2001 Confederations Cup. He played three games and Japan won second place. He played 4 games for Japan in 2001.

After the retirement, Uemura started coaching career at J2 League club Roasso Kumamoto in 2009. In 2013, he moved to J2 club Kamatamare Sanuki and served as assistant coach under manager Makoto Kitano. However the club was relegated to J3 League end of 2018 season. In 2019, Uemura became a manager as Kitano successor and he managed the club in 1 season.

Takuya Takagi

Takagi was born in Minamishimabara on November 12, 1967. After graduating from Osaka University of Commerce, he joined Japan Soccer League Division 2 club Fujita Industries in 1990. In 1991, he moved to Division 1 club Mazda (later "Sanfrecce Hiroshima"). In 1992, Japan Soccer League was folded and the club joined new league, J1 League. The club won the 2nd place in the 1994 J1 League and he was selected Best Eleven. The club also won the 1995 and 1996 Emperor's Cup. He played 173 matches and scored 62 goals for the club. In 1998, he moved to Verdy Kawasaki. In 2000, he moved to J2 League club Consadole Sapporo. The club won the champions in 2000 and was promoted to J1 from 2001. However he retired end of the 2000 season.

On May 31, 1992, Takagi debuted for the Japan national team against Argentina. In 1992, he was selected the Japan for 1992 Asian Cup which held in Japan and Japan team won the champions. He played 5 matches and scored a winning goal against Saudi Arabia at the final. In 1993, he played at 1994 World Cup qualification in Doha. However Japan failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup. It was known as the "Agony of Doha" () in Japan. He also played at 1994 Asian Games and 1996 Asian Cup. He played 44 games and scored 27 goals for Japan until 1997.

In 2006, Takagi became an assistant coach under the manager Yusuke Adachi at J2 League club Yokohama FC. In March, Adachi was sacked for poor performance and Takagi became a new manager.

Peppered moth

The peppered moth ("Biston betularia") is a species of night-flying moth. They are often used by educators as an example of natural selection: see peppered moth evolution.

The caterpillars of the peppered moth mimic the form and also the colour of the twig they rest on. The caterpillars can sense the twig’s colour with their skin and match their body colour to the background to protect themselves from predators.

Peppered moth evolution

The evolution of the peppered moth has been studied in detail over the last 150 years. At first, almost all of the moths were light coloured. This gave them camouflage against the light-coloured trees and lichens where they rested during the day. As pollution increased during the Industrial Revolution in England, many of the lichens died out. The trees became blackened by soot, and most of the light-coloured moths, or typica, became rare. At the same time, the dark-coloured, or "melanic", moths, carbonaria, flourished. This change took place because the best camouflaged moths survived better. The term industrial melanism refers to the genetic darkening of species in response to pollutants. 

Since then, with an improved environment, light-coloured peppered moths have again become common. As a result of the relatively simple and easy-to-understand circumstances of the adaptation, the peppered moth has become a common example used in explaining or demonstrating natural selection.

Melanism has appeared in the European and North American peppered moth populations. Information about the initial rise in melanic frequency is scarce. Much more is known about the subsequent fall in phenotype frequency, because it was measured with moth traps.

A black peppered moth was found in 1811, a rareity, no doubt caused by a gene mutation. By 1864 the darker 'carbonaria' form was the more common morph in Manchester. By 1895, it reached a frequency of 98% in Manchester.

From around 1962 to the present, the phenotype frequency of "carbonaria" has steadily fallen. Its decline has been measured more accurately than its rise, because of better scientific studies. Bernard Kettlewell conducted a national survey in 1956, Bruce Grant conducted a similar one in early 1996, and L.M. Cook in 2003.

Similar results were found in America. Melanic forms have not been found in Japan. This may be because peppered moths in Japan do not live in industrialised regions.

In 1896 J.W. Tutt suggested that the increased proportion of "carbonaria" was caused by differential bird predation. This meant birds took more light-coloured moths in dark areas, and more dark-coloured moths in light areas. Various experiments have been performed on predation of the peppered moth, and each has supported this hypothesis.

The most famous experiments on the peppered moth were carried out by Bernard Kettlewell under the supervision of E.B. Ford. In one of Kettlewell's experiments, moths were released into a large (18 m by 6 m) aviary, where they were fed on by Great Tits ("Parus major"). In 1953, Kettlewell experimented at Cadbury Nature Reserve in Birmingham. He marked, released and recaptured the marked moths. He found, in polluted woodland, more "typica" morphs were taken. This showed that the melanistic phenotype was important to the survival of peppered moths in such a habitat. Kettlewell repeated the experiment in 1955 in an unpolluted woodland in Dorset, and again in polluted woods in Birmingham. He was accompanied by Niko Tinbergen, and they made a film of this. Further studies by others found similar results. Finally, in 1996, work on both sides of the Atlantic found a correlation between changes in melanic frequencies and pollution levels.

A field experiment in biology will always have some artificiality, but that has to be balanced against practicality and costs. The most important aspect is that an experiment gives useful information. The only previous experiments of this type were R.A. Fisher and E.B. Ford's with the Scarlet tiger moth.

In 2000 Majerus developed plans for further experiments. In the main experiment in Cambridge from 20012007 Majerus added an experiment to find if bat predation might have skewed the results – this found that bats preyed equally on both forms of the moth. He observed a number bird species preying on the moths. The overall data led him to conclude that differential bird predation was a major factor responsible for the decline in "carbonaria" frequency compared to "typica" in Cambridge during the study period. He described his results as a complete vindication of the peppered moth story, and said "If the rise and fall of the peppered moth is one of the most visually impacting and easily understood examples of Darwinian evolution in action, it should be taught. It provides after all the proof of evolution". 

Majerus died before he could complete the writing up of his experiments, but the work was carried on by others. The paper said that "These data provide the most direct evidence yet to implicate camouflage and bird predation as the overriding explanation for the rise and fall of melanism in moths". The new data, coupled with the weight of previous data show that "industrial melanism in the peppered moth is still one of the clearest and most easily understood examples of Darwinian evolution in action".

"Biston betularia" caterpillars also occur in two forms, each adapted to a different situation. They develop body colours which match the brown or green twigs of their host plant. This is done by a mechanism called polyphenism. Polyphenism is a kind of polymorphism where different forms of an animal are caused by the same genome. The animal inherits the capability, but the environment determines which form develops. This contrasts with genetic polymorphism of the adults, where each morph (form) inherits a slightly different genome.

Polyphenism occurs when the animal inherits a developmental switch. The switch is sensitive to some environmental cue or trigger. In this case, researchers discovered that visual experience triggered precise color matching. 


Papilionoidea

The superfamily Papilionoidea (from the genus Papilio, meaning "butterfly") has all the butterflies except for the skippers, which are in the superfamily Hesperioidea, and the moth-like Hedyloidea. 

The six families of Papilionoidea are:

Ditrysia

The Ditrysia are a natural group or clade of insects in the Lepidopteran order. It contains both butterflies and moths. They are called ditrisians because the female has two distinct sexual openings: one for mating, and the other for laying eggs. 

About 98% of described species of Lepidoptera belong to Ditrysia. The group can be divided into basal or "incertae sedis" "micromoths", and the Apoditrysia. The Apoditrysia includes mostly the larger moths and the butterflies.

Lycaenidae

The Lycaenidae are the second-largest family of butterflies, with about 6000 species worldwide. They are also called gossamer-winged butterflies.

The family includes many beautiful species. Some, like the Palos Verdes blue, are critically endangered. The Lycaenids were favourites of the Russian novelist and lepidopterist Vladimir Nabokov.

Allotinus fabius

The Angled Darkie ("Allotinus fabius") is a small butterfly. It is found in India, Myanmar and South East Asia. It belongs to the Lycaenidae family. 

Allotinus

Allotinus is a genus of butterflies in the family Lycaenidae.


Nyssa (Doctor Who)

Nyssa is a fictional character in the long-running British science fiction television series "Doctor Who". She is played by Sarah Sutton. Nyssa came from the planet Traken. Nyssa was created by writer Johnny Byrne for the Fourth Doctor serial "The Keeper of Traken", but the production team later decided that she should join the Doctor on his travels. She returned in the next serial "Logopolis", in which the Fourth Doctor regenerated, and remained as a companion of the Fifth Doctor. She was a regular in the programme from 1981 to 1983. Sutton was the youngest female actor to play a companion in the series.

Nyssa is a alien from the planet Traken, the daughter of Tremas (a consul of the Traken Union) and stepdaughter of Kassia. She helps the Doctor and Adric to defeat Master. During her journeys with Tegan and Adric aboard the TARDIS, Nyssa finds herself trapped in a mathematical equation by the Master – whom she hates as he is, of course, now using "that face" (her father's). She also encounters a race of androids and their insane ruler, helps foil the genocidal plans of a wounded Terileptil and incidentally start the Great Fire of London, and discovers her remarkable resemblance to Ann Talbot.
Nyssa's fate after she leaves the TARDIS is not known, although the spin-off novel "Asylum", by Peter Darvill-Evans, reveals that she eventually leaves Terminus and settles down as an academic in a university on an unspecified planet. In "Asylum", Nyssa shares an adventure with the Fourth Doctor from a time before he met her, leaving the Doctor with the knowledge that he will have to be extremely careful dealing with Nyssa when they eventually meet to avoid changing history.

Since then, Sutton has also voiced Nyssa in several audio plays alongside Peter Davison as the Fifth Doctor, produced by Big Finish Productions.





Harry Sullivan (Doctor Who)

Harry Sullivan is a fictional character from the British science-fiction television series "Doctor Who". He was a companion of the Fourth Doctor. Harry Sullivan was played by Ian Marter, the character appears as a regular during the programme's twelfth season in 1974–1975.

Harry is a doctor in the Royal Navy, who is also a medical officer to the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce, the military organisation to which the Doctor works for as a scientific advisor. He is first mentioned (though not seen) in "Planet of the Spiders", when the Brigadier thinks the Third Doctor has gone into a coma. The Brigadier calls "Doctor Sullivan" and asks him to come to the Doctor's laboratory, but tells him not to bother when Sergeant Benton wakes the Doctor by offering him a cup of coffee. In the next serial, "Robot", after the Doctor's third regeneration, Sullivan is called in to help him, and ends up travelling aboard the TARDIS with the Fourth Doctor and Sarah-Jane Smith (played by Elisabeth Sladen) for several adventures. 

The character was originally devised by the production team to do any action scenes required in episodes when they had envisioned that the new Doctor would be played by an older actor (Sarah-Jane even jokingly compares Harry to James Bond at one point). When forty year-old Tom Baker was cast, however, this was no longer a concern and the decision was taken to write Harry out — something producer Philip Hinchcliffe later admitted was probably a mistake, as Harry was a likeable and popular character who worked well with both of his fellow leads. 

Harry's last regular appearance is in the season thirteen opener "Terror of the Zygons", which had actually been made at the conclusion of the twelfth production block and held over to start the following season. At the conclusion of this story he chooses to return to London by train rather than by TARDIS with the Doctor and Sarah-Jane, who continue their adventures without him. He does, however, reappear three stories later in "The Android Invasion", both as the original Harry and an android double. This is the character's final appearance in the programme.

A photo of Harry can be seen in Sarah-Jane Smith's attic in "The Sarah-Jane Adventures" and in "Invasion of the Bane", Sarah-Jane thought of naming her newly adopted son after him before deciding on Luke.















Fire drill

A fire drill is a sudden practice event, where people leave a building. They are practicing what they would do if there was a fire in the building. The event is started when the fire alarm goes off. The fire alarm sound can either be a continuous metal bell, a horn or a two-tone siren. Some old alarms in the UK like the Chloride Gent Warbler will curve between the two tones. The entire building is evacuated and everybody leaves the building using the nearest fire exit. At a school, college or university, the teacher or the lecturer counts the people outside to find out if anyone is missing. Sometimes people are evacuated when a drill is not scheduled by the school. This is called a false alarm. There are rules and regulations in place where fire alarm devices should be tested on a weekly basis. If the fire alarm sounds and the building is not evacuated, this may be due to the a scheduled fire alarm test that people already know about. 

In the United Kingdom, the law recommends that all schools must do a fire drill every term. But with the current UK government laws, any organization in the UK should conduct a fire drill once a year. In addition to sounding the fire alarms for regular fire drills during term time, regular health and safety checks such as testing fire alarm systems and fire extinguishers must be done weekly. During half term holidays and breaks, these tests are often done during the day so that staff who work during term time know what the fire alarm sounds like. The fire alarm in the United Kingdom sounds either a continuous two tone buzzer or a beep similar to an electronic game beeping in test mode. Sometimes depending on the sounder used, the buzzer can curve between the two tones. In the United States, different states have laws that say how often schools must have fire drills. For example, in many states, schools must have one fire drill per month and fire alarms can either be continuous, or set to different codes such as code 3. 

Fire drills commonly take place in schools, colleges and public companies. In public transport such as cruise ships, it is called a muster drill. Fire drills aren't done on airplanes, but a safety demonstration that shows the emergency procedures of the aircraft is done instead. If an aircraft is about to perform an emergency landing, the passangers on the aircraft are told to take the safety brace position on hearing the "brace" command.

During fire drills, some schools block exits with a piece of cardboard or something else that is supposed to stand for a fire. This makes people practice finding another way out of the building.


Fire alarm

A fire alarm is an electronic sounder or a bell. The alarm makes a loud, high pitched sound to notify people that there is a fire in the building. The sounders can be programmed to sound different tones. Most fire alarm sounders in Europe sound like a siren. The bell makes a continuous ringing sound.

There are also companies like HST Fire and KKmoon which produce fire alarms and pull stations. In every building, the fire alarms are hooked up to a main control panel, which allows the inspector or janitor to perform fire drills, do inspections on pull stations, and more.

Some examples of companies which make fire alarms are Wheelock, Simplex, Edwards, Gentex, Johnson Controls, Fire-Lite, and Notifier (Fire-Lite and Notifier both being owned by Honeywell). There is also Fulleon who are best known for their Roshni electronic sounder. These sounders are often used around Europe and they have 32 user selectable tones. Sometimes, old-fashioned fire alarms are metal bells. Many fire alarm systems also have flashing lights, also known as strobes. These are important for deaf people who cannot hear the fire alarm. There are also special alarms which are less loud for sleeping areas, so that people are not startled, and white fire alarms for dark walls. In larger buildings, There are 2-step systems with a recorded message, which start off by stating the emergency and waiting for the security guards to be sure there is a fire, then asking for the occupants of the building to calmly evacuate. In smaller areas, there is an immediate alarm, without voice.

Fire alarms are often used in schools and other places during fire drills, or in the case of a real fire. If somebody activates a fire alarm for fun or without reason, it is called a "false alarm". Setting off a false alarm is against the law in most places.

There are different systems, which can do the following:


DIN 14675-1 is about fire safety.It has four levels of protection:


Jiangxi

Jiangxi is a province of People's Republic of China. Its capital and largest city is Nanchang.


In vitro fertilisation

"In vitro" fertilisation (IVF) is a way to let sperm fertilise egg cells outside of the womb. IVF is used so that infertile women may still have children. 
IVF is done by:
Louise Brown, a female born in 1978 in Manchester, England, was the first ever person to be born as a result of in vitro fertilisation.

Some religious organisations believe that adoption is a better course of action for infertile couples. They think IVF is wrong because it involves inspecting embryos for defects to destroy and often results in the destruction of spare embryos. For those who believe that a person is formed at conception, this is considered killing.


Yehudi Menuhin

Yehudi Menuhin, Baron Menuhin, OM, KBE (22 April 1916 in New York City - 12 March 1999 in Berlin) was a violinist and conductor. As a child he was one of the most extraordinary violin prodigies there has ever been. He was one of the greatest violinists of the 20th century. In later life he also performed a lot as conductor. He was a very influential teacher who started a school, the Yehudi Menuhin School, near London, for musically gifted children. He was born an American citizen, but then became Swiss in 1970, and then took on British nationality in 1985.

Yehudi Menuhin was born in New York City, New York. His parents were Russian Jews who came from what is now Belarus. His sisters were Hephzibah Menuhin who became a pianist, and Yaltah Menuhin who became a pianist, painter and poet. His father, Moshe Menuhin, had been a rabbinical student and writer who oppposed Zionism.

Menuhin had his first violin lessons just after the age of four in San Francisco with the violin teacher Sigmund Anker. He immediately showed extraordinary talent. He continued to study with Louis Persinger, and performed with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra in 1924. and in New York in 1926. He performed in Paris in February 1927, after which he studied with the Romanian composer and violinist George Enescu. When he played Beethoven’s Violin Concerto with the conductor Fritz Busch in New York in November 1927 he immediately became world famous. He not only had the most amazing technique but he also understood the music just as well as any grown up musician. As a child he made many recordings. One of the most remarkable was a recording made in 1932 of Elgar’s Violin concerto. Elgar, who was then 75 years old, was conducting the orchestra.

During World War II Menuhin gave more than 500 performances for American and allied soldiers. He was the first person to perform in the Paris Opéra after the war and he went with the composer Benjamin Britten to perform for the people who were prisoners in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, after they were made free in April 1945. He returned to Germany in 1947 to perform with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra with the conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler. Many Jews said he should not have done this, because they said that Furtwängler had played for the Nazis who had killed so many Jews, but Menuhin said it was the right thing to do.

Menuhin continued to give many performances, but there were times when he did not play so well. He may have worked too hard. He had to give himself time off performing and he practised very carefully and studied meditation and yoga to help him get over his problems.

Menuhin continued to perform until he was quite old. He did not just play classical music but explored other kinds of music such as jazz which he often played with the famous jazz violinist Stéphane Grappelli, and he explored Indian music and played with the sitarist Ravi Shankar. He also conducted some of the world's greatest orchestras and founded his own chamber orchestra.

In 1959 Menuhin made his home in London. He performed a lot in England, including at the Bath Festival, but also continued to travel all over the world.

In 1962 he started a school for children who had special musical talent. It was called the Yehudi Menuhin School. The school is in Stoke d'Abernon, Surrey, just south of London.

In 1983 he founded together with Robert Masters the Yehudi Menuhin International Competition for Young Violinists. Many of today's famous violinists won prizes at this competition, including Tasmin Little and Nikolaj Znaider.

In 1991 he was given the Wolf Prize by the Israeli Government. In the Israeli Knesset he gave a speech in which he criticised Israel's occupation of the West Bank. He said that it was not right for the Jews, who have lived by strict moral behaviour for 5000 years, not to let others (meaning the Palestinians) live their lives there too.

Menuhin had many pupils who became famous, including Nigel Kennedy.

Yehudi Menuhin was married twice. He first married Nola Nicholas, daughter of an Australian industrialist, and sister of Hephzibah Menuhin's first husband. They had two children. After their divorce, he married the British ballerina and actress Diana Gould. They had two sons, Gerard and Jeremy, who became a pianist.

The name "Yehudi" means 'Jew' in Hebrew. It means "Thanks to God".

Yehudi Menuhin was given many honours from all over the world. These include the Commander of the Légion d'honneur, a Knight of the Dutch Order of Oranje Nassau, an Hon. KBE, and the Nehru Award for International Understanding. In 1993 he was made a life peer and became Lord Menuhin.

Lord Menuhin died in Berlin, Germany, from bronchitis.

Soon after his death, the Royal Academy of Music was given the Yehudi Menuhin Archive, a very large collection of musical books, letters etc. that had belonged to Yehudi Menuhin.


Yehudi Menuhin School

The Yehudi Menuhin School is a private music school in Cobham, Surrey, England. It was started in 1963 by the violinist Yehudi Menuhin.

The school is very small: there are about sixty pupils who are boys and girls between the ages of eight and nineteen. The children must have extremely good musical talent. They all play at least one musical instrument: either a stringed instrument or piano. They are taught other subjects as well, but music is the most important subject, and they are given lots of time to practise their instrument as well as music lessons to help them develop their special musical skills in classical music. Famous musicians who were pupils at the school include Nicola Benedetti, Nigel Kennedy, Tasmin Little and Alina Ibragimova.

Ofsted rate the school as 'outstanding'.


Recipe

A recipe is a list of instructions that shows how to prepare or make something such as a food dish.

Modern-day recipes are usually made up of several parts:


Recipes from earlier times often included much less information: Older recipes usually just reminded a person of the ingredients needed.

The earliest known recipes are from 1600 and came from an Akkadian tablet from southern Babylonia. The ancient Egyptians painted hieroglyphics showing the preparation of food. Many recipes are known from ancient Greece. Mithaecus's cookbook was an early one, but most of it has been lost. Athenaeus quotes one short recipe in his Deipnosophistae. Roman recipes are known with some of them starting in the 2nd century B.C with Cato the Elder's De Agri Cultura. Many other authors of this period explained eastern Mediterranean cooking in Greek and Latin.

King Richard II of England asked someone to make a recipe book called "Forme of Cury" in 1390. Around the same time another book was published entitled "Curye on Inglish". Both books give an idea of how food was made and served in the noble classes of England at that time.

By the 1400s, manuscripts appeared, describing the recipes of that time. Many of these give very good information and record the re-discovery of many herbs and spices including coriander, parsley, basil and rosemary. Many of these herbs and spices had been brought back from the Crusades.

During the 1500s and 1600s, printed books appeared. The large houses tried to be better than each other, and books were written on how to manage households and prepare food. In Holland, and England, the noble families competed to see who could make the most splendid foods.

By the 1660s cooks published their own books explaining their recipes, in competition with their rivals. Many of these books have now been translated and can be found online.

In Europe, none had such influence as the top French chefs. They built the haute cuisine which others copied. La Varenne (1615–1678), Carême (1784–1833) and Escoffier (1846–1935) were the great innovators.

By the 1800s, cooking had become a hobby throughout the world. Using the newest technology and using a new publishing idea, Mrs Beeton (1836–1865) published her famous ‘Book of Household Management’, in 24 parts between 1857 and 1861. Around that same time the American cook Fannie Farmer (1857–1915) devoted herself to cooking. She published the book ‘The Boston Cooking School Cookbook’ in 1896 which had 1849 recipes.

The next revolution in popular culture came with introduction of the media cooks. The first was Philip Harben who was first on radio, with newspaper columns and books. Then he was first on British television, before Fanny Craddock.

TV cooking programs brought the recipes of cooks to a new audience who wanted to try out new ways of cooking. In the early days, the recipes were available by post from the BBC and later with the introduction of the CEEFAX text on screen system, they became available on the television. The new companies of Channel 4 and S4C also brought recipes to the television with their own text system called ORACLE. Today the television is still a major source of recipe information, with world-wide cooks and chefs such as Julia Child, Jamie Oliver, Nigella Lawson and Rachael Ray having TV shows and websites giving the details of all their recipes.

Lee Hyori

Lee Hyo-ri (b. May 10, 1979) is a South Korean singer and actress. She debuted as a leader of the girl group, 'FIN.KL' on May, 1998. The group was rival with another group named 'S.E.S'.

Lee Hyori became a sole singer in 2003. With her debut, her fashion and activity attracted public attention. She was so popular that 'Lee Hyori syndrome' was the highest keyword in Korea.

Lee Hyori acted the leading part in drama, named 'three-leaf clover'. Despite popularity of Lee Hyori, the acting ability was criticized.

'U-Go-Girl', her 3rd album's title music, gained public interest. And another music named 'Hey Mr.BiG' also became popular. These made Lee Hyori to the highest position. Now she is member of program which SBS broadcasts. She is a huge asset to the program called "Here come the 'family'", in which she was praised to have shown her cool, honest personality.


Pygmalion effect

Pygmalion was a sculptor who lived in Cyprus. Women who lived on Cyprus didn't stay virtuous, so Pygmalion decided to live alone and made a perfect sculpture, Galatea. During the Aphrodite feast, thanks to Pygmalion`s prayers, the sculpture turned into a real person. This was called The Pygmalion effect.

The Pygmalion effect shows that if we want something enough, we'll get it. It is named after the scholar who demonstrated it. It is also called "Rosenthal Effect" and is quoted when we refer to "The power of affirmation" and "The power of praise".

Another example of the Pygmalion effect is in groups. If there are two groups, one group thought that their teacher was "good", the other group thought he was "not good". The teacher treated both groups the same, but the group with a positive expectations had better outcomes than the others; Simply because those with positive expectations made them perform better than other students.

The Pygmalion effect is also an important instrument in management theory. It makes managers be aware, that the success of their employees depends not only on qualification, personal qualities or working environment. Manager always has to believe in his people and expect them to achieve the best results. In such case the subordinates will always feel this trust and demonstrate their best skills and abilities in their work.

Jet lag

Jet lag is a physiological condition, often occurring when humans travel from one time zone to another. It happens because of the time difference between two places. Some people suffer from jet lag more than other people do.

If the departure time (the original body clock) is not the same as the destination time, jet lag can occur. Traveling east is more likely to cause jet lag than traveling west. That is because a cycle of the human's biological time is usually more than 24 hours, and going east makes the day shorter, which is a more difficult adjustment.
Jet lag can have several symptoms. It usually takes the form of fatigue and insomnia. Also, headache, depression, even nausea may strike people. Sufferers can use caffeine or sleeping pills as a way of treatment. Using caffeine (such as in tea or coffee) is helpful, either in the morning when going westward or in the afternoon when going eastward. The hormone melatonin is said to help people sleep. Also, doing things like changing sleeping patterns several days before departure may help people adjust to the new time zone.

Korean International Circuit

The Korean International Circuit is a racetrack being made in Yeongam County, South Jeolla Province, of South Korea. This is 400 kilometres from the capital, Seoul. This track will be 5.684 km long. This will be the longest track in Asia. The main purpose of this track will be Formula One (F1) races. F1 will race at this track for at least 7 years starting in 2010. It will also be used for local races.

Charlie Whiting, technical delegate for the FIA completed a two-day inspection on 10 October 2010. While much of the circuit facilities are still under construction, the circuit itself is ready for Formula One racing.

Special attention was given to the top layer of asphalt. This final layer was installed the week before the inspection.

FIA rules normally require approval at least 90 days before the race. The FIA had to stretch their own rules to allow the Korean Grand Prix to take place.

German designer Hermann Tilke designed the track. The track has two parts. One permanent part (3.047 km) will be used for local races. One temporary part (2.643 km) will be joined to the permanent part and be used for F1 races. The track has 18 corners. The track will be next to a lake, so some people will be able to see the races from their boats.

A number of problems were uncovered on the first day of practice. Drivers complained about the blind entrance to the pit lane. Jarno Trulli called it "very dangerous". A number of cars have bottomed out at turn 16. Charlie Whiting has asked that the corner be changed. The track was slippery and dusty. Lewis Hamilton said "It was the dirtiest circuit I have ever been on," and "It was so dusty it was incredible." The problems with the turn 16 was fixed before the qualifying session the next day.

Dangun

In Korean mythology, Dangun was the grandson of the gods, and the founder of Gojoseon, who set up the capital at Asadal. Legends say that around 4,340 years ago, "Joseon" was the name of the country that became Korea. So Dangun is believed to be an ancestor of the Korean nation. There was also a kingdom called "Joseon" later in Korean history, so Dangun's kingdom is called "Go" (meaning "Ancient") Joseon.

Once upon a time, Hwanung, the god Hwanin`s son, wanted to go down to the human world. Hwanin noticed that and let Hwanung go down to the human world with three amulets. Hwanung went to the Sindansu in Mount Taebaek, with his 3,000 followers. He managed the human world`s agriculture, morals, and 363 other fields of societal work. All these things went well.

One day, two animals visited Hwanung, begging him to change them to human beings. One was a tiger, and the other was a bear. Hwanung gave them an armful of divine wormwood and twenty cloves of divine garlic, and said: "Eat those for 100 days without being exposed to the sunshine. Then you will become human beings."

The two animals went to the cave and followed Hwanung`s orders. But during this process, the tiger could not endure this trial, and rushed out from the cave. On the other hand, the bear endured the trial and became a woman. But nobody was willing to marry her. So the bear woman prayed to conceive a baby at Sindansu. Then Hwanung transformed himself into human being for a while and married her. The bear woman gave birth to a baby. That baby was Dangun.

Dangun managed Gojoseon for 1,500 years, and after that long period, Giza succeeded to the throne. Dangun retired from the world and became a mountain god.

Yi Sun-sin

Admiral Yi Sun-sin (March 8, 1545 – November 19, 1598) was a Joseon dynasty admiral. He fought the Japanese navy in the Imjin war. He is a national hero of Korea.

Yi was born in Geoncheon-dong, Seoul on March 8, 1545. Because his family was poor, he moved to and grew up in his mother's hometown, Asan, in Chungcheongnam province.

Ulleungdo

Ulleungdo is a South Korean island, the main part of Ulleung County, North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea, in the East Sea. This island is at 37°30'N 130°52'E. The part of this island is the peak of a mountain. This mountain is a large stratovolcano which rises from the seafloor. The formation time of this volcanic mountain is between the Cainozoic Third Era and the Cenozoic Fourth Era. The highest peak of Ulleungdo is Seonginbong peak at 984 meters. The Nari Basin and Albong Basin were made by the collapsing aldera crater in the northern slope. Ulleungdo is a pentagon shaped island. The length from east to west is 10 km, the length from south to north is 9.5 km, and the total length of the seashore is about 56.5 km.

The relics of the Bronze Age like dolmens or patternless earthenwares were unearthed in Hyunpo, Namsu and Judongri. According to Samguk Sagi and Samguk Yusa, there was Usan-guk in Silla. But in June 512, ruler Lee Sa Bu conquered the Usan-guk. In the early 1000's, Japanese called Ulleungdo Uruma. Tribute was continued during the Goryeo. In the early 11 century, after the Usan-guk people who was attacked by Yeojin ran away to the mainland, Ulleungdo and Dokdo became direct controlled territory of the Goryeo. In march 1407, the ruler of Tsushima Island sent envoy, presented the local products and sent back the victims for getting a approval that ruler of Tsushima Island administered the Ulleungdo. But the king of Chosun, Tae Jong, rejected it. In the formal term of Chosun, there were a lot of damages because of Japanese's plunder. So the king of Chosun, Tae Jong, enforced the "empty-island" policy. In Sejong True Record Geographical Feature Papers, there is a record about Ulleungdo which are called Usan-guk. In 1614, the ruler of Tsushima sent a letter that they should look around the Ulleungdo according to the order of Tokugawa Ieyasu. But the king of Chosun, Gwang Hae Gun also rejected it and issued an order that banned Japanese not to come-and-go the Ulleungdo. In 1618, the government of Tokugawa gave the license to Otani and Murikawa Family to go to Ulleungdo. But Chosun people already lived in Ulleungdo. That Families complained about that to the government of Tokugawa, but the government of Tokugawas could not give the practical support to them. After having a controversy about Ulleungdo, the Japan´s feudal government;the shogunate banned Japanese to go to Ulleungdo. In 1787, The LaPerouse Expedition Party of France measured the Ulleungdo at first time and they called the Ulleungdo Dagelet. Finally in 1884, the king of Go Jong removed the "empty island" policy and reclaimed the Ulleungdo.

Dongdongju

Dongdongju is a traditional liquor in Gyeonggi-do, Korea. Dongdongju was named because the grains of boiled rice float to the surface of the drink while it is brewed. It is also called Buryuju(floating alcohol).

There are two ways to brew Dongdongju. One way is to brew with non-glutinous rice, yeast, wheat flour, and water. The other way is to brew with glutinous rice, yeast powder, and water. In the Korean book named "Kyu Gon Si Ui Bang", the making process of Dongdongju is written very precisely.

In 1983, the Korean cultural assets office sent a report of investigation and designated Kwon O soo to the making vocational technician of Kyungi Dongdongju. According to him, with 100 kilogram of glutinous rice, 14L of water (14%), and 15 kg of yeast (15%), 240L of Dongdongju can be brewed about 15~20 days.

Obelisk

An obelisk is a monument made out of stone, much like a column but supporting nothing.

Obelisks were erected by Ancient Egyptians for commemoration. Obelisks were usually made of a single piece of stone. 

A bird's eye view of obelisk is square and this structure has gradually tapering four sides and its ends in a pyramidal top.

Obelisks originated with the holy stone of sanctuary which served the sun god, Ra, in Heliopolis. There usually was a pair in front of a gate or sanctuary, and on each side of obelisk there were written hymns and some actions of the of king in hieroglyphics.

Obelisks can have interior spaces.

There are similar forms of obelisks in Europe and America, and some were taken from Egypt by Europeans and Americans. The Washington Monument is a large, modern, built obelisk.

Survival horror

Survival horror is a video game genre based on horror movies where the main character has to survive while in danger and escape, for example during a zombie attack. Survival Horror games are influenced by both Western and Japanese culture. 

The name "survival horror" was first used by the horror game "Resident Evil", but there had been some earlier games which created the genre, among them "Alone in the Dark". Survival Horror games are different from other video games because the main character of the games are usually ordinary people and the amount of ammunition and resources the player has is usually not very much: to not be prepared or equipped for the situation is often important for the genre. A few Survival Horror games are "Resident Evil" and "Bioshock".

Muster drill

A muster drill (sometimes called lifeboat drill) is a practice event which usually takes place on holiday cruise ships. The purpose of a muster drill is to show passengers what to do if there was a real emergency. The muster station leaders tell passengers about how to put on a life jacket, where the muster stations are and also explains other emergency information on the ship. The drill itself has to be completed before the ship leaves. Muster drills are not required on ferries, but safety announcements are made before the ferry departs. There was a rule where life jackets were needed to be worn at the drill but there has been some changes to the rules and most cruise liners do not require life jackets at the drill. 

Before a muster drill starts, the captain announces over a loud speaker 30 minutes before, 15 minutes before and when the emergency alarm signal is about be sounded. The general emergency alarm is seven short blasts followed by one long blast of the ships horn/whistle and alarms that are built into the ship. The alarm inside the ship is usually a musical note which is sometimes joined with another to make a nicer sound. 

Signal: 7 short and 1 long:

Hurricane Lane (2006)

Hurricane Lane was the strongest Pacific hurricane that made landfall in Mexico since Hurricane Kenna. It was the 13th named storm, 9th hurricane, and 6th strong hurricane of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. Lane began from a tropical wave on September 13, while it was to the south of Mexico. It moved towards the northwest along Mexico, and it quickly gained strength. After turning towards the northeast, Lane reached its peak winds of 125 mph (205 km/h), and it made landfall in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. It quickly weakened and died out on September 17

Near its path, Lane caused four deaths. The damage was worst in Sinaloa. In that area, crops were badly damaged. Moderate flooding happened in Acapulco, which caused mudslides in some areas. Damage in the country totaled to $2.2 billion (2006 MXN, $203 million (2006 USD). 


Paraceratherium

Paraceratherium is an extinct genus of mammal. It was a large rhinoceros without a horn. It lived in Eurasia during the late Oligocene epoch of the Tertiary period, (34–23 million years ago).

"Paraceratherium" was one of the largest ever land mammals. Its exact size is unclear because of the incompleteness of the fossils. The size of adults was about tall at the shoulder, about in length. Estimates of its weight have varied greatly.

It was a herbivore that stripped leaves from trees. It had a long, low, hornless skull and long frontal and nasal bones. Its front teeth had a single pair of incisors in either jaw. They were round, pointed, and so large that they looked like small tusks. The upper incisors pointed straight downwards, while the lower ones jutted outwards. The upper lip was evidently extremely mobile. The neck was very long, the body big and strong, and the limbs long and thick, column-like.

Its exact size is unclear because of the incompleteness of the fossils. Estimates have been based on skull, teeth, and limb bone measurements. However, the known bone elements are from individuals of different sizes. All skeletal reconstructions are composite extrapolations. This resulted in weight estimates from 11 to 20 tonnes. Its shoulder height has been estimated as . Its length was about from front to back. As explained, such figure are only approximations. These figures are for the largest of the three species in the genus.

They lived in a huge rainforest floodplain in the area which is now Kazakhstan, India, and southwest China. They lived further inland throughout northern and central Asia as well. This area was a rainforest before the Himalayan uplift changed the climate.

Berlin Philharmonic

Berlin Philharmonic (in German: Die Berliner Philharmoniker), is an orchestra from Berlin, Germany. It is one of the greatest orchestras in the world. The conductor of the orchestra is Sir Simon Rattle.

The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra was founded in Berlin in the spring of 1882. By 1887 they were known by their present name. Hans von Bülow became their conductor that year and made them into a world class orchestra. Other great conductors were also invited to conduct as guests: Hans Richter, Felix von Weingartner, Richard Strauss, Gustav Mahler, Johannes Brahms and Edvard Grieg. 

In 1895, Arthur Nikisch became chief conductor, and was followed in 1923 by Wilhelm Furtwängler. The orchestra continued to perform throughout World War II. After Furtwängler fled to Switzerland in 1945, Leo Borchard became chief conductor, but a few months later he was accidentally shot and killed by American forces occupying Berlin. Sergiu Celibidache then took over as chief conductor for seven years, from 1945 to1952. Furtwängler returned in 1952 and conducted the orchestra until his death in 1954.

Herbert von Karajan led the orchestra from 1955 until he resigned in April 1989. He was a very strict conductor who had to be obeyed in everything he did. The orchestra made lots of great recordings with him. 

After Karajan, Claudio Abbado became principal conductor. He helped the orchestra to learn new works, not just the well known classical and romantic works but also the more modern 20th century works. He stopped conducting the Berlin Philharmonic in 2002. At the time Germany was being reunited the orchestra had financial problems.

In June 1999, the musicians chose Sir Simon Rattle as their next chief conductor. Rattle made the orchestra into a self-governing body. This meant that they made their own financial decisions and chose the works they would perform and who would be invited to perform with them. 

The first concert hall of the orchestra was destroyed during WWII in 1944. Since 1963, the orchestra has had a new concert hall called the Philharmonie. On 20 May 2008, a fire broke out at the Philharmonie. A quarter of the roof was damaged and the orchestra could not play there for some time.

The orchestra have won many awards for their playing.

UNICEF appointed the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and Sir Simon Rattle as Goodwill Ambassadors in November 2007.

On 18 December 2008 the Orchestra announced that a Digital Concert Hall would be built. This new internet platform will allow music fans all over the world to see and hear the Philharmonic’s concerts – live or on demand.

Agate

Agate is a kind of quartz and it is a mineral. Agate can come in many different kinds and colors. Agate deposits are primarily found in large rocks such as boulders. They take ~50 million years to form. It is characterized by colored band patterns inside various rocks. Often, agates are also accompanied by Amethyst deposits inside.

RNA virus

RNA viruses are viruses that use RNA as their genetic material. In humans, well-known RNA viruses are those that cause SARS, Influenza or Hepatitis C.

Viruses that are not RNA viruses use DNA for their genome and are called DNA viruses.

Viruses have a classification system, invented by David Baltimore, a Nobel Prize winner. The RNA viruses in the Baltimore system are classified as:
"Sense" in RNA means "ready to make proteins, as messenger RNA does". "Antisense" in RNA means "complementary to messenger RNA". In complete complementarity each nucleotide is across from its opposite number, so antisense RNA can produce sense RNA. 

Another system is run by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). It uses terms from the familiar Linnaean taxonomy, like orders and families.

RNA viruses have very high mutation rates compared to DNA viruses. This is because viral RNA polymerases lack the proof-reading ability of DNA polymerases. This explains why it is difficult to make effective vaccines to prevent diseases caused by RNA viruses.

Some genes of RNA virus are important to the viral replication cycles and mutations are not tolerated. For example, the bit of the hepatitis C virus genome which encodes the core protein is highly conserved, because it is essential to start translation.


DNA virus

DNA viruses use DNA for their genome. An example of a DNA virus is Herpes simplex. Viruses that are not DNA viruses use RNA for their genome and are called RNA viruses.

Zygnematales

The Zygnematales also called the Conjugales, are an order of green algae, comprising several thousand different species in genera such as the well-known "Zygnema" and "Spirogyra". All the members of this group develop into unbranched filaments, one cell thick, which grow longer through normal cell division. Most live in freshwater, and form an important component of the algal scum that grows on or near plants, rocks, and various debris.

Zygnematophyceae

Zygnematophyceae is a class of green algae. It has two orders: Zygnematales and Desmidiales.

Mydoom

The Mydoom virus (also known as a worm and as Win32.Mydoom.A) was a very damaging computer virus that affected Microsoft Windows-based computers. The worm was spread through mass emailing, disguised as badly sent email. It spread very quickly.

The virus was made to be sent in an email with an attachment that carried the virus. When the attachment was opened, the virus would download itself to the computer. The virus can only affect Windows based computers. The virus came with a package that would spam the SCO Group website. SCO had caused arguments within the Linux community for getting copyrights on some open source software. However, only 25% of the infected computers would launch the attack. After the virus has been downloaded, it leaves the computer open to other malware by leaving a "backdoor" open.

Another type of the virus, Mydoom.B, was made to spam Microsoft. It was first found on January 28, 2004.

The virus was found to be a threat on January 26, 2004. The virus quickly spread and proved a threat to the SCO group. To try and get the public to catch the maker of the virus, the SCO group offered $250,000 U.S. dollars as a reward for catching the creator. Another type of the virus, Mydoom.B was found on January 28. Because it was made to attack the Microsoft web site, Microsoft offered a $250,000 U.S. dollar reward if the maker of the virus was caught. This was the third time Microsoft offered a reward for catching a virus creator.

On February 1, 2004, the virus downed the SCO group site with many denial-of-service attacks. On February 3 the virus attacked the Microsoft site and little damage was caused.

Mydoom caused many problems during its lifespan in 2004. It caused web speeds to slow by about 50%. At the peak of the infection, Mydoom made for one in twelve emails sent.


Ulvophyceae

The Ulvophyceae or Ulvophytes are class of green algae. Other well-known members include "Ulothrix", "Acetabularia" and "Caulerpa". Others, such as "Cladophora", "Rhizoclonium" and "Pithophora" live in fresh water and in some areas are considered weeds.
